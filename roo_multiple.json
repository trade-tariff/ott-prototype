Such notification may stipulate that subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall cease to apply to the UK.\n\n2. Products originating in Viet Nam shall, on importation into the UK, benefit from the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement upon submission of any of the following proofs of origin:\n\n   1. a certificate of origin made out in accordance with Articles 16 (Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin) to 18 (Issuance of a Duplicate Certificate of Origin);\n\n   2. an origin declaration made out in accordance with Article 19 (Conditions for Making out an Origin Declaration) by any exporter for consignments the total value of which is to be determined in the national legislation of Viet Nam and shall not exceed EUR 6 000;\n\n   3. an origin declaration made out in accordance with Article 19 (Conditions for Making out an Origin Declaration) by an exporter approved or registered in accordance with the relevant legislation of Viet Nam after Viet Nam has notified to the UK that such legislation applies to its exporters.

Originating products within the meaning of this Origin Reference Document shall, in the cases specified in Article 24 (Exemptions from Proof of Origin), benefit from the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement without requiring the submission of any of the documents referred to in this Article.\n\n\n\n## Article 16 - Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin\n\n1. A certificate of origin shall be issued by the competent authorities of the exporting Party on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.\n\n2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the certificate of origin, specimen of which appears in Annex VII to this Origin Reference Document, and the application form. The specimen of the application form to be used for exports from the UK to Viet Nam appears in Annex VII to this Origin Reference Document; the specimen of the application form to be used for exports from Viet Nam to the UK shall be determined in the domestic legislation of Viet Nam. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the domestic law of the exporting Party. If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through to prevent any subsequent addition.\n\n3. The exporter applying for the issuance of a certificate of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the competent authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.\n\n4. A certificate of origin shall be issued by the competent authorities of the exporting Party if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Viet Nam and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.\n\n5. The competent authorities issuing certificates of origin shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.\n\n6. The date of issuance of the certificate of origin shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.\n\n7. The certificate of origin shall be issued as soon as possible to but not later than three working days after the date of exportation (the declared shipment date).\n\n\n\n## Article 17 - Certificates of Origin Issued Retrospectively\n\n1. Notwithstanding paragraph 7 of Article 16 (Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin), a certificate of origin may also be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates in specific situations where:\n   1. it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors, involuntary omissions or other valid reasons;\n   2. it is demonstrated to the competent authorities that a certificate of origin was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons; or\n   3. the final destination of the products concerned was not known at the time of exportation and was determined during their transportation, storage or after splitting of consignments in accordance with Article 13 (Non-Alteration).\n\n2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the certificate of origin relates, and state the reasons for his request.\n\n3. The competent authorities may issue a certificate of origin retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application conforms with that in the corresponding file.\n\n4. Certificates of origin issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase in English: \n\n    \"ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY\".\n\n5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the certificate of origin. \n\n\n\n## Article 18 - Issuance of a Duplicate Certificate of Origin\n\n1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a certificate of origin, the exporter may apply to the competent authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.\n\n2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with the following word in English: \n\n    \"DUPLICATE\".\n\n3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate certificate of origin.\n\n4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original certificate of origin, shall take effect as from that date.\n\n\n\n## Article 19 - Conditions for Making out an Origin Declaration\n\n1. An origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Viet Nam and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.\n\n2. The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the competent authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.\n\n3. An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter on the invoice, the delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient details to enable them to be identified, by typing, stamping or printing on that document the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex VI to this Origin Reference Document, in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting Party. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in capital characters.\n\n4. Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 20 (Approved Exporter) shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the competent authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.\n\n5. An origin declaration may be made out after exportation provided that it is presented in the importing Party no later than two years, or the period specified in the legislation of the importing Party, after the entry of the goods into the territory.\n\n6. The conditions for making out an origin declaration referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 apply mutatis mutandis to statements of origin made out by an exporter registered as provided for in subparagraphs 1(c) and 2(c) of Article 15 (General Requirements). \n\n\n\n## Article 20 - Approved Exporter\n\n1. The competent authorities of the exporting Party may authorise any exporter (hereinafter referred to as \"approved exporter\") who exports products under the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation shall offer to the satisfaction of the competent authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.\n\n2. The competent authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions specified in domestic legislation which they consider appropriate.\n\n3. The competent authorities shall grant to the approved exporter an authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.\n\n4. The competent authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.\n\n5. The competent authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so when the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation. \n\n\n\n## Article 21 - Validity of Proof of Origin\n\n1. A proof of origin shall be valid for 12 months from the date of issuance in the exporting Party, and shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party within that period.\n\n2. Proofs of origin which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the period of validity referred to in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purpose of applying preferential tariff treatment, when the importer failed to submit those documents by the final date of the period of validity due to force majeure or other valid reasons beyond that person's control.\n\n3. In other cases of belated presentation, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the proofs of origin when the products have been imported within the period of validity referred to in paragraph 1.\n\n\n\n## Article 22 - Submission of Proof of Origin\n\nFor the purpose of claiming preferential tariff treatment, proofs of origin shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that Party. Those authorities may request a translation of the proof of origin if it is not issued in English. \n\n\n\n## Article 23 - Importation by Instalments\n\nWhere, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of paragraph 2(a) of Part Two, Section 1, of the Tariff of the United Kingdom falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of HS 2012 are imported by instalments, a single proof of origin for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.\n\n\n\n## Article 24 - Exemptions from Proof of Origin\n\n1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of a proof of origin, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Origin Reference Document and where there is no doubt as to the veracity of such declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22, CN23 or on a sheet of paper attached to that document.\n\n2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose exists.\n\n3. Furthermore, the total value of the products referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not exceed:\n\n   1. when entering the UK, EUR 500 in the case of small packages or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage;\n\n   2. when entering Viet Nam, USD 200, both in the case of small packages and in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.\n\n\n\n## Article 25 - Supporting Documents\n\nThe documents referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 16 (Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin) and paragraph 2 of Article 19 (Conditions for Making out an Origin Declaration), used for the purpose of proving that products covered by an origin declaration or a certificate of origin can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Viet Nam and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document, may consist, inter alia, of the following:\n\n- direct evidence of the manufacturing or other processes carried out by the exporter or supplier to obtain the goods concerned, contained for example in his accounts or internal book- keeping;\n\n- documents proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in a Party, where those documents are used in accordance with domestic law;\n\n- documents proving the working or processing of materials in a Party, issued or made out in a Party, where those documents are used in accordance with domestic law; or\n\n- proof of origin proving the originating status of materials used, issued or made out in a Party in accordance with this Origin Reference Document.\n\n\n\n## Article 26 - Preservation of Proof of Origin and Supporting Documents\n\n1. The exporter making out an origin declaration or applying for the issuance of a certificate of origin shall keep for at least three years a copy of this origin declaration or of the certificate of origin as well as of the documents referred to in paragraph 3 of Article 16 (Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin) and paragraph 2 of Article 19 (Conditions for Making out an Origin Declaration).\n\n2. The competent authorities of the exporting Party issuing a certificate of origin shall keep for at least three years the application form referred to in in paragraph 2 of Article 16 (Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin).\n\n3. The customs authorities of the importing Party shall keep for at least three years the proofs of origin submitted to them.\n\n4. Each Party shall permit, in accordance with that Party's laws and regulations, exporters in its territory to maintain documentation or records in any form or medium, provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed.\n\n\n\n## Article 27 - Discrepancies and Formal Errors\n\n1. The discovery of slight discrepancies between the statements made in the proof of origin and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the products shall not ipso facto render the proof of origin null and void if it is duly established that this document corresponds to the products submitted.\n\n2. Obvious formal errors such as typing errors on a proof of origin shall not cause this document to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made in this document.\n\n3. For multiple goods declared under the same proof of origin, a problem encountered with one of the goods listed shall not affect or delay the granting of preferential tariff treatment and customs clearance of the remaining goods listed in the proof of origin.\n\n\n\n## Article 28 - Amounts Expressed in Euro\n\n1. For the application of subparagraph 1(b)(ii) of Article 15 (General Requirements) and subparagraph 3(a) of Article 24 (Exemptions from Proof of Origin) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currency of the UK or of Viet Nam equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by each Party.\n\n2. A consignment shall benefit from subparagraph 1(b)(ii) of Article 15 (General Requirements) and subparagraph 3(a) of Article 24 (Exemptions from Proof of Origin) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Party concerned.\n\n3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The amounts shall be communicated by 15 October and shall apply from 1 January of the following year. The Parties shall notify each other of the relevant amounts.\n\n4. A Party may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 per cent. A Party may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 per cent in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion would result in a decrease in that equivalent value.\n\n\n\n{{ Articles 15 to 28 }}\n"

For the purpose of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (General Requirements), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document are fulfilled.\n\n2. The conditions referred to in paragraph 1 indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials.\n\n    If a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.\n\n3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating materials which, in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product, may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:\n\n    (a) 10 per cent of the weight of the product or ex-works price for products of Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of HS 2012, other than processed fishery products referred to in Chapter 16 of HS 2012; or\n\n    (b) 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products of Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2012, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex I to this Origin Reference Document apply.\n\n4. Paragraph 3 shall not allow exceeding any of the percentages for the maximum value or weight of non-originating materials as specified in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document.\n\n5.

Without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification), the tolerance provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4 applies to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product for which Annex II to this Origin Reference Document requires that such materials be wholly obtained.\n\n{{ Article 5 }}\n"

For the purpose of implementing the provisions of paragraph 1, the competent authorities of the importing Party shall return the certificate of origin and the invoice, if it has been submitted, or the origin declaration, or a copy of these documents, to the competent authorities of the exporting Party giving, where appropriate, the reasons for the enquiry. Any documents and information obtained suggesting that the information given on the proof of origin is incorrect shall be forwarded in support of the request for verification.\n\n3. The verification shall be carried out by the competent authorities of the exporting Party. For that purpose, they shall have the right to request any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate.\n\n4. If the competent authorities of the importing Party decide to suspend the granting of preferential tariff treatment to the products concerned while awaiting the results of the verification, release of the products shall be offered to the importer subject to any precautionary measures deemed necessary.
