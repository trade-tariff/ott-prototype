      <p class="b">Tariff preferences</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">What about the import of goods from Iceland and Norway, where the trader might need to decide whether to import from Iceland, Iceland EEA, EEA?
      Do we have the ability to take the lowest applicable preference?</p>

      <p class="b">GSPs</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">Treat GSPs as tariff preferences - need to think about the possibility of comparing a country that is in both GSP and has its own preference.</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">0101299000 - In UK tariff, Ghana is in GSP with a 6.5% rate; in EU tariff, Ghana is own preference on 0.00%.
      Will need a note to show that there is a process difference between GSP and standard tariff preferences.</p>

      <p class="b">Quotas</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">Presumption is that there are no EU quotas that the NI trader can use, including safeguard quotas.</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">We need to exclude UK safeguard quotas from this point</p>

      <p class="b">Suspensions</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">UK and EU suspensions are the same in terms of measure types, but probably differ in terms of the
      comm code applicability and possibly the rates.</p>

      <p class="b">Trade Defence measures</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">In a way these are simpler - if there is an EU Trade Defence measure, then the EU at risk
      duty applies in all cases - measure types 551, 552, 553, 554, 695, 696.</p>
      <p class="teal govuk-body-s">We do not show the per-company calculations in MVP</p>

      <h1 class="govuk-heading-m">Questions</h1>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-body-s">
        <li>What do we do about Iceland - 2012, 2014 and IS - how do we draw a comparison point for tariff preferences?</li>
        <li>Do we treat GSPs as identical to tariff preferences for comparison perspective - e.g. Ghana?</li>
        <li>Presume that the safeguard quotas also wipe out the MFN in cases where there is a non-zero MFN?</li>
        <li>Whata re we doing about aligning the UK and EU addtional codes for trade remedy companies</li>
