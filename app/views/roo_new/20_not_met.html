                                Part A is made of non-originating materials. The rule of origin for this part requires a change in tariff classification (CTC rule). The rule of origin is met and part A is considered originating. It is then used to manufacture the final product B which will be exported to an FTA partner. The rule of origin for the final product B requires non-originating materials not to exceed 40% of the value of the product (VA rule).
