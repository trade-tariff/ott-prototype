            <p>
                <strong>Product-specific rules</strong> define how a product needs to be processed to be considered as originating in
                {{ context.country_name if context.trade_direction == "import" else "the United Kingdom" }}
                and therefore eligible for preferential tariff treatment.
            </p>

            <p>
                If there are multiple rules, your product needs only comply with one of them.
            </p>

                        Broadly speaking, there are four types of rule that determine if your product has been sufficiently
                        transformed to be considered as originating.

                            <strong>The 'value added' rule</strong><br>
                            The value of all non-originating materials used cannot exceed a given percentage of the productâ€™s ex-works price.

                            The production process results in a change of tariff classification between the non-originating materials
                            and the final product.

                            A specific production process is required. For example, spinning fibres into yarns. Such rules are mostly used

            <p>
                You will also be required to demonstrate that the work carried out on non-originating components
                goes beyond the <strong>minimal operations</strong> requirements defined in the {{ context.scheme_title }}.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the production performed in your country is one of those listed and nothing else was made there, meaning
                no material was produced or transformed, the product cannot be considered as originating, even if
                the product-specific rules of origin were satisfied.

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Including parts or components from other countries</h2>
            <p>
                You may also be able to include non-originating materials imported from third countries or processing
                carried out in a non-partner country, as originating in the EU or a trade partner country,
                according to the <strong>cumulation rules </strong> of the {{ context.scheme_title }}.
