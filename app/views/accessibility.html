            <p class="govuk-body">This service is part of the wider GOV.UK website. There is a <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/help/accessibility">separate accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Using this service</h2>

            <p class="govuk-body">The Check How to Import or Export Goods service allows you to check what you need to have in place during the import or export process. The service will help you to understand the rules, licences or certificates that apply to your goods, to pay the right tax and duty for your goods, register your business for trading and declare your goods to clear the UK border.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service. This means you should be able to:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
                <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
                <li>get from the start of the service to the end using just a keyboard</li>
                <li>get from the start of the service to the end using speech recognition software</li>
                <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">We have also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How accessible this service is</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">This service is partially compliant with the <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>.</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:</p>

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                <li>On the search results tables, the visual category numbers are not identical to the visually hidden category numbers. This means that voice control users will not be able to target the links correctly and screen readers will hear a different category number from the one they were expecting</li>

                <li>With search results tables, screen reader users are unable to tell where the beginning is, or end is for each section. There is also no way for them to skip past sections. This means that they will have to navigate through every row to find the code they need. For screen magnification users, the search results tables are difficult to use as there is a large amount of information to get through with limited screen space. This will mean they will have to navigate back and forth to ensure they are looking at the correct section</li>

                <li>When using a small screen, such as on a mobile phone or when using increased font sizes, the search table results do not fit on the screen fully</li>

            </ul>
