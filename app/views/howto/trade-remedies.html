            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="definition">What are trade remedies, safeguards and retaliatory duties?</h2>

            <p>Trade remedies, also known as trade defence measures, are trade policy tools which allow the UK to protect domestic industries from unfair competition from products imported from other countries.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Anti-dumping duties</h3>
            <p>Anti-dumping duties can be applied when goods are exported from a trading partner and sold in the UK for a price which is below the market value and where there is a genuine impact on the competing domestic industry. This practice is known as “dumping”.</p>
            
            <p>In order to apply these duties, the UK needs to conduct an investigation and demonstrate that dumping is taking place and injuring domestic producers.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Countervailing measures</h3>
            <p>Countervailing measures are measures against subsidies offered by the exporting country to its domestic producers. If the subsidies in the trading party have an adverse impact on the UK's domestic industry, countervailing duties may be applied.</p>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-bottom-1">Safeguards</h3>
            <p>Safeguards are temporary restrictions on imports irrespective of their source. These measures can be used in cases when there is a substantial increase in the quantities of a product being imported that is having a substantial impact or threat of impact on the competing domestic industry.</p>

            <p>Like with anti-dumping duties, the UK authorities are required to conduct an investigation before applying countervailing measures or safeguards.</p>



            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="worldwide">Are trade remedies used internationally?</h2>

            <p>Trade remedies are an internationally recognised trade policy tool. The WTO sets out rules and guidelines to ensure that countries apply such measures only in justifiable cases where there is a genuine threat to the domestic industry. In most, cases the domestic authorities are required to undertake an investigation to demonstrate and quantify the impact.</p>

            <p>Trade remedies are covered by the WTO agreements: WTO Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of the GATT, the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.</p>


            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="usage">How does the UK apply trade remedies?</h2>

            <p>In the UK, trade remedies investigations are conducted by the UK's Trade Remedies Authority. The <a href="https://www.trade-remedies.service.gov.uk" target="_blank">Trade Remedies Service</a> allows UK companies to participate in ongoing trade remedies cases and request new reviews.</p>


            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="impact">How do trade remedies impact UK importers?</h2>

            <p>UK importers should check the duties on UK Tariff to see whether their products are subject to any trade remedy measures.  If trade remedies apply to goods imported from a given country, the importer will need to pay the amount on top of standard customs duties and import VAT.</p>
