          Search term not recognised

{# <p>The search term used[or the exact term] is not recognised in the Tariff.  However, you may be looking for…”</p> #}
<p>There isn’t a single commodity code for ‘<b>{{ context.search_term }}</b>’.</p>
<p>Classification is specific to the type of good being imported so, to find the right code, you need to know the details about your product. This may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the type of product</li>
  <li>the purpose of the product</li>
  <li>the materials used to make it</li>
  <li>the production methods used to make it</li>
  <li>the way it’s packaged</li>
</ul>

<p>To find the correct commodity code these steps will help you get started:</p>
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
  <li>Enter the search term you want to use – an item may not be listed by name, it may come under what it’s used for or made from.</li>
  <li>The tool will suggest a section or number of sections, divided into chapters.</li>
  <li>The headings in each chapter describe a product, only select a sub-heading if your item is accurately described.</li>
  <li>If your item is not accurately described, check further down the list – if none of the sub-headings match your item use the ‘other’ heading.</li>
</ol>
