            <p>You must accurately describe your item to search the tool. These steps will help you get started:</p>

            <ol class="steps" style="font-size:19px">
                <li>Enter the search term you want to use – an item may not be listed by name, it may come under what it’s used for or made from.</li>
                <li>The tool will suggest a section or number of sections, divided into chapters.</li>
                <li>The headings in each chapter describe a product, only select a sub-heading if your item is accurately described.</li>
                <li>If your item is not accurately described, check further down the list – if none of the sub-headings match your item use the ‘other’ heading.</li>
            </ol>
