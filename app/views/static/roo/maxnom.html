            <p>"MaxNOM" means the maximum value of non-originating materials expressed as a percentage.</p>

            <p>If a rule requires a "maximum level of non-originating material" (MaxNOM), a certain proportion
            of the value of the final good must be generated in one of the parties to the Trade Agreement.
            This can include originating parts, or value added in the production such as labour and manufacturing costs.

            <p>For the calculation of MaxNOM , the following formula applies:</p>
            <p class="formula">MaxNOM(%) = (VNM/EXW) x 100</p>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li><a href="/static/roo/vnm">VNM</a> means the value of non-originating materials used in the production of the product</li>
                <li><a href="/static/roo/exw">EXW</a> means the price paid for the product ex-works (i.e. when it leaves the factory)</li>
            </ul>
