<p>"RVC" means the minimum regional value content of a product, expressed as a percentage.</p>
<p>For a minority of goods, a specific rule of origin will require the good to meet an
    additional requirement to qualify as originating.</p>
<p>Usually, this additional requirement tests the good's regional value content (RVC), which requires that a
    certain percentage of the good's value originates in an FTA country.</p>
<p>For example, some rules may specify that a good must have at least a 35% RVC
    based on the build-up method. To qualify for originating status under the FTA,
    therefore, importers have to demonstrate that at least 35% of the good's value
    originated in the territory of the other party as determined using the build-up
    method.</p>
<p>If a rule requires an HS classification change and an RVC test, the good has to
    meet both of these requirements to be an originating good.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Calculating regional value content</h2>
<p>Regional Value Content may be calculated using the Build Down method or the Build Up method.</p>
<p>Unless specified in the rule, exporters or producers can choose the RVC method
    to be used.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Build-down Method</h3>
<p class="formula">RVC = ((AV - VNM) / AV)) * 100</p>
<p>where:
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>VC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage;</li>
    <li>AV is the adjusted value (the value for customs purposes), and</li>
    <li>VNM is the value of non-originating materials that are acquired and
        used by the producer in the production of the good. VNM does
        not include the value of a material that is self-produced</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Build-up Method</h3>
<p class="formula">RVC = (VOM / AV) x 100</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage;</li>
    <li>AV is the adjusted value (the value for customs purposes); and</li>
    <li>VOM is the value of originating materials that are acquired or selfproduced,
        and used by the producer in the production of the
        good.</li>
</ul>
