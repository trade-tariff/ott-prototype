118 	Tariff suspension subject to the production of a special certificate. No case has been found at present, such a possibility could however be created e.g. for goods to be denatured before being imported under a suspension.
119 	Tariff suspension subject to Authorised Release Certificate formerly known as Airworthiness Certificates. Suspension of duty (not including VAT) for importations of civil aircraft parts which must be accompanied by an Authorised Release Certificate formerly known as airworthiness certificate.
