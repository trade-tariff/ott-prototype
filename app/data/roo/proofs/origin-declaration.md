Origin declaration
You can make an origin declaration (also known as an 'invoice declaration' or ‘statement on origin’) on a commercial document that has enough detail in it to identify the origin of the goods. The document can be:

an invoice
a packing list
a delivery note
If your commercial document does not have enough space to include all the information, you can include it on a separate letter-headed continuation paper. A letter-headed paper on its own will not be accepted. The commercial document and continuation paper must clearly refer to each other.

You can claim preference for different goods on the same document. You’ll need to clearly identify and show the goods that are originating and non-originating.

Origin declarations must be presented to HMRC within 2 years of the date your goods were imported.

You should check how long an origin declaration will remain valid in the relevant trade agreement.

If the trade agreement says you must be an ‘approved exporter’
Depending on the trade agreement, you may only be able to use an origin declaration for consignments over £5,400 if you have applied for and received approved exporter status.

If you have approved exporter status you will not need to present the origin declaration to HMRC to be checked before exporting to:

customs
a Chamber of Commerce office
an Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers office
To apply, you must prove to HMRC that:

you export or intend to export goods on a regular basis
the goods to be exported meet the relevant origin rules to qualify for the issue of preference documents
you will correctly complete the documents and take proper care of them
If you’re an approved exporter, you can complete an origin declaration without a signature if you confirm in writing that you accept full responsibility for the declaration. You must have been given approval by HMRC (known as a ‘signature waiver’) to do this as part of getting approved exporter status.

If you do not have a signature waiver approval from HMRC, you must sign your origin declaration.

If the trade agreement does not mention ‘approved exporter’
You can complete an origin declaration for consignments of any value, but you must include your EORI number in the origin declaration.
