## EUR1 and EUR-MED movement certificates

### Green paper certificates

To get a green paper copy of a EUR1 or EUR-MED movement certificate, contact either your local:

- Chambers of Commerce
- office of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

> You may be charged a fee for the certificate.

Due to coronavirus (COVID-19), HMRC can only issue original green paper EUR1 or EUR-MED movement certificates in cases where the customs authority in the country of destination:

- requires a wet stamped certificate
- does not accept PDF copies or digital versions

Where easements are in place in the country you’re exporting to allow for PDF copy and digital certificates, complete the following online forms and email them to HMRC:

- to claim preferential duty rates on goods exported to countries that have a preferential trading agreement with the EU — complete EUR1 (C1299)
- to record preferential trade in goods between the UK and participating countries — complete EUR-MED (C1300)

1. Download and fill in the form — remember to include your company’s email address.
2. Attach it to an email.
3. In the email subject line use:

- ‘EUR1 endorsement’ if you’re sending a EUR1 (C1299)
- ‘EUR-MED endorsement’ if you’re sending a EUR-MED (C1300)

4. Send your email to [NCH.Movements.Digital@hmrc.gov.uk](NCH.Movements.Digital@hmrc.gov.uk).

HMRC will check and verify your application. If appropriate, we will issue a plain PDF version back to your company’s email address within 48 hours.

Once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, your customer may ask you to send them an original certificate. HMRC can issue one to you, but you must give us evidence that the customs authority in the country of destination has specifically asked for it. You will need to email your request and evidence to: [NCH.Movements.Digital@hmrc.gov.uk](NCH.Movements.Digital@hmrc.gov.uk).

If the customer you’re exporting goods to cannot accept a PDF copy of the certificate and no other easements are being put in place by the customs authority in the country of destination, you can request a paper C1299 by using one of [HMRC services](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/customs-international-trade-and-excise-enquiries). You must send the completed form to:

HM Revenue and Customs
NCH MICS Team (EUR1s)
Ralli Quays
3 Stanley Street
Salford
M60 9HL

You can also send the completed paper form to your local:

- Chambers of Commerce
- office of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

> You may be charged a fee for the certificate.

### Retrospective EUR1 or EUR-MED certificates
You can ask for a EUR1 or EUR-MED movement certificate retrospectively if the certificate was:

- not issued at the time of exportation due to an error, oversight or special circumstance (such as a preferential rate of duty becoming available for the products from a retrospective date)
- issued at the time of exportation, but could not be accepted at the time of importation for technical reasons (for example, it did not contain all necessary information)

To request a certificate, contact the National Clearance Hub or your local:

- Chambers of Commerce
- office of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

> You may be charged a fee for the certificate.

If the certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen
You can ask for a duplicate certificate from HMRC. You will need to declare in writing that you do not have the original but will surrender it immediately to us if it becomes available later. To request a certificate, contact the National Clearance Hub or your local:

- Chambers of Commerce
- office of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

> You may be charged a fee for the certificate.

Pre-printed ‘duplicate’ or ‘copy’ certificates are sometimes issued at the same time as the original. You cannot use these to replace an original certificate.

### If you need to split a consignment
You need to get a certificate for each part of the consignment you’ve split. This is known as a ‘replacement certificate’.

It replaces all or part of the original certificate.

To request a certificate, contact the [National Clearance Hub](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/national-clearance-hub) or your local:

- Chambers of Commerce
- office of the Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers

> You may be charged a fee for the certificate.
