#### Procedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 will be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting Overseas Territory on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter’s responsibility, by his authorised representative.

2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative will fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Appendix III and IV. These forms will be completed in accordance with this Annex. If they are hand-written, they will be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 will be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Overseas Territory where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.

4. A movement certificate EUR.1 will be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting Overseas Territories if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in an Overseas Territory, in the UK or in an EPA country and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.

5. The issuing customs authorities will take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex. For this purpose, they will be permitted to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities will also ensure that the forms referred to in subparagraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they will check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 will be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.

7. A movement certificate EUR.1 will be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

#### Movement certificate EUR.1 issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding paragraph 22, a movement certificate EUR.1 may be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

    (a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances;

    (b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons;

    (c) a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued at the time of exportation for a consignment which was subsequently split in a third country of storage, in accordance with paragraph 18 of this Annex, provided that the initial EUR.1 certificate is returned to the customs authorities who issued it; or

    (d) it was not issued at the time of exportation because the final destination of the consignment was not known at the time, and the destination was determined during its storage and after possible splitting of the consignment in a third country in accordance with paragraph 18 of this Annex.

2. For the implementation of subparagraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.

3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter’s application agrees with that in the corresponding file.

4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively must be endorsed with the following phrases in the ‘Remarks’ box (Box 7) of the movement certificate EUR.1.

    ‘ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY’

5. The endorsement referred to in subparagraph 4 will be inserted in the ‘Remarks’ box of the movement certificate EUR.1.

#### Issue of duplicate movement certificate EUR.1

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate movement certificate EUR.1 will be endorsed in the ‘Remarks’ box (Box 7) with the following word:

    ‘DUPLICATE’.

3. The endorsement referred to in subparagraph 2 will be inserted in the ‘Remarks’ box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.

4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, will take effect as from that date.

#### Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously

When originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the UK or in an Overseas Territory, it will be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the UK or an Overseas Territory. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 will be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.
