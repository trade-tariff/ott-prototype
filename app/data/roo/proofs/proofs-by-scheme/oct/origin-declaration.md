An 'invoice declaration', given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The text of the invoice declaration appears in Annex IV of the [origin reference document](ord).

Invoice declarations are also known as origin declarations. Find out more about using [origin declarations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-proof-of-origin-for-your-goods#origin-declaration).

#### Criteria for making out an origin declaration

1. An origin declaration as referred to in paragraph 21 (b) of this Annex may be made out:

    (a) by an approved exporter as referred to in paragraph 27 of this Annex; or

    (b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products the total value of which does not exceed Â£10,000.

2. An origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in an Overseas Territory, in an EPA country or in the UK and fulfil the other requirements of this Annex.

3. The exporter making out an origin declaration will be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Overseas Territory, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.

4. An origin declaration will be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the origin declaration described in paragraph 21 and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting Overseas Territory. If the declaration is hand-written, it will be written in ink in printed characters.

5. Origin declarations will bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of paragraph 27 of this Annex will not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Overseas Territory a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.

6. An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation provided that it is presented in the UK no longer than two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.

#### Approved exporter

1. The customs authorities of the exporting Overseas Territory may authorise any exporter to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation will offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Annex.

2. The customs authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any provisions which they consider appropriate.

3. The customs authorities will grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which will appear on the origin declaration.

4. The customs authorities will monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.

5. The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They will do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in subparagraph 1, does not fulfil the provisions referred to in subparagraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.
