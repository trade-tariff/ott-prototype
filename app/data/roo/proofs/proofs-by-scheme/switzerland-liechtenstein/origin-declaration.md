An 'origin declaration', given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The text of the invoice declaration appears in Appendix 4 of the [origin reference document](ord).

An origin declaration may be made out:

- by an approved exporter, _or_

- by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed £5,500 / 6,000 euros.

#### Conditions for making out an origin declaration

1. An origin declaration as referred to in subparagraph (b) of Article 17(1) may be made out:

    (a) by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 19; or

    (b) by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products the total value of which does not exceed EUR 6 000.

2. An origin declaration may be made out if the products can be considered as originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex III to this Origin Reference Document, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.

5. Origin declarations shall bear the signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 19 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him. Each Party shall permit an origin declaration to be sent electronically and directly from the exporter in one Party to an importer in the other Party. Such an approach will allow the use of electronic signatures or identification codes.

6. An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation (the “retrospective origin declaration”) on condition that it is presented in the importing country within two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.

Where the splitting of a consignment takes place in accordance with Article 14(3) and provided that the same two-year deadline is respected, the retrospective origin declaration shall be made out by the approved exporter of the exporting Party of the products.

#### Approved exporter

1. The customs authorities of the exporting Party may, subject to national requirements, authorise any exporter established in that Party (the “approved exporter”), to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned.

2. An exporter who requests such authorisation must offer, to the satisfaction of the customs authorities, all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.

4. The customs authorities shall verify the proper use of an authorisation. They may withdraw the authorisation if the approved exporter makes improper use of it and shall do so if the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 2.
