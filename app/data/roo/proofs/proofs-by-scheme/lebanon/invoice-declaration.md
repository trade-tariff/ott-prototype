An 'invoice declaration', given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The text of the invoice declaration appears in Appendix 4 of the [origin reference document](ord).

The invoice declaration may be made out:

- by an approved exporter, _or_

- by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products whose total value does not exceed Â£5,500 / 6,000 euros.

Invoice declarations are also known as origin declarations. Find out more about using [origin declarations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-proof-of-origin-for-your-goods#origin-declaration).
