#### Procedure for the Issuance of a Movement Certificate EUR.1

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the competent authorities or customs authorities of the exporting Party on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his/her authorised representative.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the exporter or his/her authorised representative shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Appendix 3. These forms shall be completed in Spanish or English and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting Party. If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the competent authorities or customs authorities of the exporting Party where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the competent authorities or customs authorities of a Member State of the European Union or of the signatory Andean Countries if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the European Union or in the signatory Andean Countries and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

5. The competent authorities or customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document. For this purpose, such authorities shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The said authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, the competent authorities or customs authorities shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in box 11 of the certificate.

7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the competent authorities or customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as the actual exportation has been effected or ensured.


#### Movement Certificate EUR.1 Issued Retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 16, paragraph 7, a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after the exportation of the products to which it relates if: 

(a) a movement certificate was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or 

(b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent authorities or customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

1. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his/her application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates and state the reasons for his/her request.

2. The competent authorities or customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application coincides with that in the corresponding file. 

3. Movement certificates EUR 1 issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with one of the following phrases: 

    ES ‘EXPEDIDO A POSTERIORI’ 

    EN ‘ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY’
 
5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the 'Remarks' box of the movement certificate EUR.1.


#### Issuance of a Duplicate Movement Certificate EUR.1

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the competent authority or customs authority which issued such certificate for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession. 

2. The duplicate issued pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be endorsed with one of the following words: 

    ES ‘DUPLICADO’ 

    EN ‘DUPLICATE’ 

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the 'Remarks' box of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1. 

4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1 shall take effect as from that date.

#### Issuance of Movement Certificates EUR.1 on the Basis of a Proof of Origin Previously Issued or Made Out

When originating products are placed under the control of a customs authority in the UK, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the UK or the signatory Andean Countries. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 shall be issued by the competent authority or by the customs authority, in this last case, under whose control the products are placed.
