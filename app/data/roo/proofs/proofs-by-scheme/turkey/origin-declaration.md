The origin declaration is provided on an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable its identification. The texts of the origin declarations appear in Annexes IVa and b of the [Origin Reference document](ord).

In the UK, the exporterâ€™s reference number will be the EORI number. If you do not have one, you can [apply for an EORI number](https://www.gov.uk/eori). In Turkey, Approved Exporters should use their Approved Exporter number as the authorisation number. Other exporters should leave the authorisation number blank.

1. An origin declaration shall:

    (a) take the form of a written self-declaration of origin which may be in the form set out in Annex 4 (Text of the Origin Declaration) made by the exporter which clearly states that the goods imported meet the conditions required for preferential treatment under the terms of the United Kingdom-Turkey Agreement; and

    (b) be provided on, or attached to, an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.

2. Each Party shall permit an origin declaration to be sent electronically and directly from the exporter in one Party to an importer in the other Party. Such an approach will allow the use of electronic signatures or identification codes. 

#### Validity of the origin declaration

1. Each Party shall provide that an origin declaration shall be valid for 12 months from the date it was completed, or for such longer period of time as provided by the importing Party. The preferential treatment may be claimed, within this validity period, from the customs authority of the importing Party.

2. Each Party shall provide that an origin declaration may apply to:

    (a) a single shipment of originating goods into the territory of a Party; or 

    (b) multiple shipments of identical originating goods within any period specified in the origin declaration not exceeding 12 months.

1. The importing Party may accept an origin declaration submitted to its customs authority after the validity period for the purpose of preferential treatment in accordance with that Party's laws and regulations.

2. If unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of paragraph 2(a) of Part Two, Section 1, of the Tariff of the United Kingdom falling within Sections XV to XXI of HS 2017 are imported by instalments, a single origin declaration for such products may be used on request of the importer and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party. 

#### Exemptions from origin declaration requirements

1. Each Party may, in conformity with its laws and regulations, waive the requirement to present an origin declaration for low value importations of originating goods from the other Party.

2. Each Party may exclude any importation from the provisions of paragraph 1 when the importation is part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this Origin Reference Document related to origin declarations.

3. Each Party may set value limits for products referred to in paragraph 1, and shall exchange information with the other Party regarding those limits.
