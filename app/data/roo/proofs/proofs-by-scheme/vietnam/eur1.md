#### Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin

1. A certificate of origin shall be issued by the competent authorities of the exporting Party on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.

2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the certificate of origin, specimen of which appears in Annex VII to this Origin Reference Document, and the application form. The specimen of the application form to be used for exports from the UK to Viet Nam appears in Annex VII to this Origin Reference Document; the specimen of the application form to be used for exports from Viet Nam to the UK shall be determined in the domestic legislation of Viet Nam. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the domestic law of the exporting Party. If they are hand-written, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through to prevent any subsequent addition.

3. The exporter applying for the issuance of a certificate of origin shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the competent authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. A certificate of origin shall be issued by the competent authorities of the exporting Party if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Viet Nam and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

5. The competent authorities issuing certificates of origin shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issuance of the certificate of origin shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.

7. The certificate of origin shall be issued as soon as possible to but not later than three working days after the date of exportation (the declared shipment date).

#### Certificates of Origin Issued Retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding paragraph 7 of Article 16 (Procedure for the Issuance of a Certificate of Origin), a certificate of origin may also be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates in specific situations where:

    (a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors, involuntary omissions or other valid reasons;

    (b) it is demonstrated to the competent authorities that a certificate of origin was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons; or

    (c) the final destination of the products concerned was not known at the time of exportation and was determined during their transportation, storage or after splitting of consignments in accordance with Article 13 (Non-Alteration).

2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the certificate of origin relates, and state the reasons for his request.

3. The competent authorities may issue a certificate of origin retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application conforms with that in the corresponding file.

4. Certificates of origin issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase in English:

    "ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY".

5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the certificate of origin. 

#### Issuance of a Duplicate Certificate of Origin

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a certificate of origin, the exporter may apply to the competent authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with the following word in English: 

    "DUPLICATE".

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate certificate of origin.

4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original certificate of origin, shall take effect as from that date.
