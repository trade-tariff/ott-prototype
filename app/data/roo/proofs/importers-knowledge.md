Importer’s knowledge
In some agreements, an importer can claim preference using knowledge they have about the origin of the goods they are importing. This is known as ‘importer’s knowledge’. This can be used instead of an origin declaration.

You will need to have supporting documents or records which should cover:

the commodity code
a brief description of the production process (including the origin of the goods used)
if the origin was based on ‘wholly obtained’ — give category for the goods
if the origin was based on ‘sufficiently worked or processed’ give one of the following:
the value of the product as well as the value of all the non-originating or, as appropriate to establish compliance with the value requirement, originating materials used in the production
the weight of the product as well as the weight of the relevant non-originating or, as appropriate to establish compliance with the weight requirement, originating materials used in the product
a list of all the non-originating materials including their commodity code (in 2, 4 or 6 digit format depending on the origin criteria)
if the goods have been altered or transformed
any additional information that will help verify the origin of the goods, if HMRC asks for it
If you or the person receiving your goods cannot give this information for commercial reasons you should use an origin declaration.
