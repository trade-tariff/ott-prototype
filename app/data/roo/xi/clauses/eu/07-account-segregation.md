Article ORIG.14: Accounting segregation

1. Originating and non-originating fungible materials or "fungible products" shall be physically segregated during storage in order to maintain their originating and non-originating status.

2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, ‘fungible materials’ or "fungible products" means materials or products that are of the same kind and commercial quality, with the same technical and physical characteristics, and that cannot be distinguished from one another for origin purposes.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating and non-originating fungible materials may be used in the production of a product without being physically segregated during storage if an accounting segregation method is used.

4. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating and non-originating fungible products classified in Chapter 10, 15, 27, 28, 29, heading 32.01 to 32.07, or heading 39.01 to 39.14 of the Harmonised System may be stored in a Party before exportation to the other Party without being physically segregated provided that an accounting segregation method is used.

5. The accounting segregation method referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be applied in conformity with a stock management method under accounting principles which are generally accepted in the Party.
 

6. The accounting segregation method shall be any method that ensures that at any time no more materials or products receive originating status than would be the case if the materials or products had been physically segregated.

7. A Party may require, under conditions set out in its laws or regulations, that the use of an accounting segregation method is subject to prior authorisation by the customs authorities of that Party. The customs authorities of the Party shall monitor the use of such authorisations and may withdraw an authorisation if the holder makes improper use of the accounting segregation method or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Chapter.
