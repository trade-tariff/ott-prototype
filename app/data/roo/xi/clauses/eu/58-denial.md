with requirements under this Chapter other than those relating to the originating status of the products.

3. If the customs authority of the importing Party has sufficient justification to deny preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1 of this Article, in cases where the customs authority of the exporting Party has provided an opinion pursuant to point (b) of Article ORIG.25(4) [Administrative cooperation] confirming the originating status of the products, the customs authority of the importing Party shall notify the customs authority of the exporting Party of its intention to deny the preferential tariff treatment within two months after the date of receipt of that opinion.

If such notification is made, consultations shall be held at the request of either Party, within three months after the date of the notification. The period for consultation may be extended on a case-by- case basis by mutual agreement between the customs authorities of the Parties. The consultation may take place in accordance with the procedure set by the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin.

Upon the expiry of the period for consultation, if the customs authority of the importing Party cannot confirm that the product is originating, it may deny the preferential tariff treatment if it has a sufficient justification for doing so and after having granted the importer the right to be heard. However, when the customs authority of the exporting Party confirms the originating status of the products and provides justification for such conclusion, the customs authority of the importing Party shall not deny preferential tariff treatment to a product on the sole ground that Article ORIG.25(5) [Administrative cooperation] has been applied.

4. In all cases, the settlement of differences between the importer and the customs authority of the Party of import shall be under the law of the Party of import.
