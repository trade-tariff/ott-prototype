Article ORIG.21: Importer’s knowledge

1. For the purposes of a claim for preferential tariff treatment that is made under point (b) of Article ORIG.18(2) [Claim for preferential tariff treatment], the importer’s knowledge that a product is originating in the exporting Party shall be based on information demonstrating that the product is originating and satisfies the requirements provided for in this Chapter.

2. Before claiming the preferential treatment, in the event that an importer is unable to obtain the information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article as a result of the exporter deeming it to be confidential information or for any other reason, the exporter may provide a statement on origin so that the importer may claim the preferential tariff treatment on the basis of point (a) of Article ORIG.18(2) [Claim for Preferential Tariff Treatment].
