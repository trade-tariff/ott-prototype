Article ORIG.23: Small consignments

1. By way of derogation from Articles ORIG.18 [Claim for Preferential Tariff Treatment] to ORIG.21 [Importer’s Knowledge], provided that the product has been declared as meeting the requirements of this Chapter and the customs authority of the importing Party has no doubts as to the veracity of that declaration, the importing Party shall grant preferential tariff treatment to:

(a) a product sent in a small package from private persons to private persons;

(b) a product forming part of a traveller’s personal luggage; and

(c) for the United Kingdom, in addition to points (a) and (b), other low value consignments.

2. The following products are excluded from the application of paragraph 1 of this Article:

(a) products, the importation of which forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been made separately for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of Article ORIG.18 [Claim for Preferential Tariff Treatment];

(b) for the Union:

(i) a product imported by way of trade; the imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families are not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is intended; and

(ii) products, the total value of which exceeds EUR 500 in the case of products sent in small packages, or EUR 1 200 in the case of products forming part of a traveller’s personal luggage. The amounts to be used in a given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October. The exchange rate amounts shall be those published for that day by the European Central Bank, unless a different amount is communicated to the European Commission by 15 October, and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The European Commission shall notify the United Kingdom of the relevant amounts. The Union may establish other limits which it will communicate to the United Kingdom; and

(c) for the United Kingdom, products whose total value exceeds the limits set under the domestic law of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom will communicate these limits to the Union.

3. The importer shall be responsible for the correctness of the declaration and for the compliance with the requirements provided for in this Chapter. The record-keeping requirements set out in Article ORIG.22 [Record-keeping requirements] shall not apply to the importer under this Article.
