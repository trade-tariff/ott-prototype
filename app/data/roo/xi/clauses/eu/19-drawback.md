Article ORIG.17: Review of drawback of, or exemption from, customs duties

Not earlier than 2 years from the entry into force of this Agreement, at the request of either Party, the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin shall review the Partiesâ€™ respective duty drawback and inward-processing schemes. For this purpose, at the request of a Party, no later than 60 days from that request, the other Party shall provide the requesting Party with available information and detailed statistics covering the period from the entry into force of this Agreement, or the previous 5 years if that is shorter, on the operation of its duty-drawback and inward-processing scheme. In the light of this review, the Trade Specialised Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin may make recommendations to the Partnership Council for the
 

amendment of the provisions of this Chapter and its Annexes, with a view to introducing limitations or restrictions with respect to drawback of or exemption from customs duties.
