Article ORIG.6: Tolerances

1. If a product does not satisfy the requirements set out in ANNEX ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] due to the use of a non-originating material in its production, that product shall nevertheless be considered as originating in a Party, provided that:

(a) the total weight of non-originating materials used in the production of products classified under Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of the Harmonised System, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16, does not exceed 15% of the weight of the product;

(b) the total value of non-originating materials for all other products, except for products classified under Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System does not exceed 10% of the ex-works price of the product; or

(c) for a product classified under Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonised System, the tolerances set out in Note 7 and 8 of ANNEX ORIG-1 [Introductory Notes to the Product-Specific Rules of Origin] apply.
 

2. Paragraph 1 does not apply if the value or weight of non-originating materials used in the production of a product exceeds any of the percentages for the maximum value or weight of non- originating materials as specified in the requirements set out in ANNEX ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin].

3. Paragraph 1 of this Article does not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article ORIG.5 [Wholly obtained products]. If ANNEX ORIG-2 [Product-specific rules of origin] requires that the materials used in the production of a product are wholly obtained, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article apply.
