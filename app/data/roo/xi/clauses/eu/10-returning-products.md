If a product originating in a Party exported from that Party to a third country returns to that Party, it shall be considered as a non-originating product unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authority of that Party that the returning product:

(a) is the same as that exported; and

(b) has not undergone any operation other than what was necessary to preserve it in good condition while in that third country or while being exported.
