ARTICLE 22

Delayed claims for preferential treatment

Each Party shall, in conformity with its laws and regulations, provide that, if a good would have qualified as originating when it was imported into the territory of that Party but the importer did not have an origin declaration at the time of importation, the importer of the good may, within a period of time of no less than two years after the date of importation, apply for a refund of duties paid as a result of the good not having been accorded preferential tariff treatment.
