ARTICLE 12

Accounting segregation

1. If originating and non-originating fungible materials are used in the working or processing of a product, economic operators may ensure the management of materials using the accounting segregation method, without keeping the materials on separate stocks.

2. Economic operators may ensure the management of originating and non- originating fungible products of heading 1701 using the accounting segregation method, without keeping the products on separate stocks.

3. Parties may require that the application of accounting segregation be subject to prior authorisation by the customs authorities. The customs authorities may grant the authorisation subject to any conditions they deem appropriate and shall monitor the use made of the authorisation. The customs authorities may withdraw the authorisation whenever the beneficiary makes improper use of the authorisation in any manner whatsoever or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Protocol. Through the use of accounting segregation, it must be ensured that, at any time, no more products can be considered as “originating in the exporting Party” than would have been the case if a method of physical segregation of the stocks had been used. The method shall be applied and the application thereof shall be recorded on the basis of the general accounting principles applicable in the exporting Party.

4. The beneficiary of the method referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall make out or apply for proofs of origin for the quantity of products which may be considered as originating in the exporting Party. At the request of the customs authorities, the beneficiary shall provide a statement of how the quantities have been managed.
