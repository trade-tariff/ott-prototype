### ARTICLE 6 - Sufficient working or processing

1. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 and to Article 8, products which are not wholly obtained in a Party shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions laid down in the list in Annex 2 for the goods concerned are fulfilled.


2. If a product which has obtained originating status in a Party in accordance with paragraph 1 is used as a material in the manufacture of another product, no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

3. The determination of whether the requirements of paragraph 1 are met shall be carried out for each product. However, where the relevant rule is based on compliance with a maximum content of non-originating materials, the customs authorities of the Parties may authorise exporters to calculate the ex-works price of the products and the value of the non-originating materials on an average basis as set out in paragraph 4, in order to take into account the fluctuations in costs and currency rates.

4. Where the second sentence of paragraph 3 applies, an average ex-works price of the product and average value of non-originating materials used shall be calculated respectively on the basis of the sum of the ex-works prices charged for all sales of the products carried out during the preceding fiscal year and the sum of the value of all the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products over the preceding fiscal year as defined by the exporting Party, or, where figures for a complete fiscal year are not available, a shorter period which should not be less than three months.

5. Exporters having opted for calculation on an average basis shall consistently apply such a method during the year following the fiscal year of reference, or, where appropriate, during the year following the shorter period used as a reference. They may cease to apply such a method where during a given fiscal year, or a shorter representative period of no less than three months, they record that the fluctuations in costs or currency rates which justified the use of such a method have ceased.

6. The averages referred to in paragraph 4 shall be used as the ex-works price and the value of non-originating materials, respectively, for the purpose of establishing compliance with the maximum content of non-originating materials.
