Sets

Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 of the Harmonized System, shall be regarded as originating when all the component products are originating. When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole shall also be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.
