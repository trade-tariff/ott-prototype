1. The conditions set out in Title II shall be fulfilled without any interruption in the Party concerned.

2. If originating products exported from the United Kingdom or Turkey to another country are returned, they shall be considered to be non-originating, unless it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(a) the products returned are the same as those which were exported; and

(b) they have not undergone any operations beyond those necessary to preserve them in good condition while in that country or while being exported.

3. The acquisition of originating status in accordance with the conditions set out in Title II shall not be affected by working or processing done outside the exporting Party on materials exported from that Party and subsequently re- imported there, provided:

(a) those materials are wholly obtained in the exporting Party or have undergone working or processing beyond the operations referred to in Article 8 prior to being exported; and

(b) it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that:

(i) the re-imported products have been obtained by working or processing the exported materials; and

(ii) the total added value acquired outside the exporting Party by applying this Article does not exceed 10 % of the ex-works price of the end product for which originating status is claimed.

4. For the purposes of paragraph 3, the conditions for obtaining originating status set out in Title II shall not apply to working or processing done outside the exporting Party. However, where, in the list in Annex 2, a rule setting a maximum value for all the non-originating materials incorporated is applied in determining the originating status of the end product, the total value of the non- originating materials incorporated in the territory of the exporting Party, taken together with the total added value acquired outside that Party by applying the provisions of this Article, shall not exceed the stated percentage.

5. For the purposes of applying paragraphs 3 and 4, “total added value” shall be taken to mean all costs arising outside the exporting Party, including the value of the materials incorporated there.

6. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products which do not fulfil the conditions set out in the list in Annex 2 or which can be considered sufficiently worked or processed only if the general tolerance fixed in Article 7 is applied.

7. Any working or processing of the kind covered by this Article and done outside the exporting Party shall be done under the outward processing arrangements, or similar arrangements.
