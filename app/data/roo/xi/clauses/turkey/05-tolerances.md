1. By way of derogation from Article 6 and subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, non- originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex 2, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total net weight or value assessed for the product does not exceed:

(a) 15 % of the net weight of the product falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;

(b) 15 % of the ex-works price of the product for products other than those covered by subparagraph (a).

2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex 1 shall apply.

3. Paragraph 1 of this Article shall not allow any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Annex 2 to be exceeded.

4. Paragraphs 1 and 3 of this Article shall not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 5.
