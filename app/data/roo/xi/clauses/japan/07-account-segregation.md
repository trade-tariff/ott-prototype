Accounting segregation


1. Originating and non-originating fungible materials shall be physically segregated during storage in order to maintain their originating status.

2. For the purposes of this Article, "fungible materials" means materials that are of the same kind and commercial quality, with the same technical and physical characteristics, and which cannot be distinguished from one another once they are incorporated into the finished product.

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating and non-originating fungible materials may be used in the production of a product without being physically segregated during storage provided that an accounting segregation method is used.

4. The accounting segregation method referred to in paragraph 3 shall be applied in conformity with an inventory management method under accounting principles which are generally accepted in the Party.
 
5. A Party may require, under conditions set out in its laws and regulations, that the use of an accounting segregation method is subject to prior authorisation by the customs authority of that Party. The customs authority of the Party shall monitor the use of the authorisation and may withdraw the authorisation if the holder makes improper use of the accounting segregation method or fails to fulfil any of the other conditions laid down in this Chapter.

6. The accounting segregation method shall be any method that ensures that at any time no more materials receive originating status than would be the case if the materials had been physically segregated.
