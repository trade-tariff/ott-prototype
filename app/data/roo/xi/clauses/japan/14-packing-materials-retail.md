Packaging materials and containers for retail sale


1. Packaging materials and containers in which a product is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the product, shall be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the product have undergone the applicable change in tariff classification or a production process set out in Annex 3-B or whether the product is wholly obtained.
 
2. If a product is subject to a value requirement set out in Annex 3-B, the value of the packaging materials and containers in which the product is packaged for retail sale, if classified with the product, shall be taken into account as originating or non-originating, as the case may be, in the calculation for the purpose of the application of the value requirement to the product.
