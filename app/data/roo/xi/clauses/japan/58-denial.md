(a) within three months after the date of the request for information pursuant to paragraph 1 of Article 3.21:

(i) no reply is provided; or


(ii) if the claim for preferential tariff treatment was based on the importer's knowledge as referred to in subparagraph 2(b) of Article 3.16, the information provided is inadequate to confirm that the product is originating;
 
(b) within three months after the date of the request for information pursuant to paragraph 5 of Article 3.21:

(d) following a prior request for assistance pursuant to Article 3.23 and within a mutually agreed period, in respect of products which have been the subject of a claim as referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 3.16:

(i) the customs authority of the exporting Party fails to provide the assistance; or


(ii) the result of that assistance is inadequate to confirm that the product is originating.


2. The customs authority of the importing Party may deny preferential tariff treatment to a product for which an importer claims preferential tariff treatment where the importer fails to comply with requirements of this Chapter other than those relating to the originating status of the products.
 
3. If the customs authority of the importing Party has sufficient justification to deny preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1, in cases where the customs authority of the exporting Party has provided an opinion pursuant to subparagraph 4(b) of Article 3.22 confirming the originating status of the products, the customs authority of the importing Party shall notify the customs authority of the exporting Party of its intention to deny the preferential tariff treatment within two months after the date of receipt of that opinion. If such notification is made, consultations shall be held on request of a Party, within three months after the date of the notification. The period for consultation may be extended on a case by case basis by mutual agreement between the Parties. The consultation may take place in accordance with the procedure set out by the Committee on Rules of Origin and Customs-Related Matters established pursuant to Article 23.3. Upon the expiry of the period for consultation, the customs authority of the importing Party may deny the preferential tariff treatment solely on the basis of sufficient justification and after having granted the importer the right to be heard.
