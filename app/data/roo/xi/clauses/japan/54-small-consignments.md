ARTICLE 3.20


Small consignments and waivers


1. Products sent as small packages from private persons to private persons or forming part of travellers' personal luggage shall be admitted as originating products provided that such products are not imported by way of trade1, have been declared as satisfying the requirements of this Chapter and if there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration.

2. Provided that the importation does not form part of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been made separately for the purpose of avoiding the requirement for a statement on origin, the total value of the products referred to in paragraph 1 shall not exceed such value limits as the importing Party may set out in its laws and regulations and which have been notified to the other Party.

3. Each Party may provide that the basis for the claim as referred to in paragraph 2 of
Article 3.16 shall not be required for an importation of a product for which the importing Party has waived the requirements.


1 The imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is in view.
