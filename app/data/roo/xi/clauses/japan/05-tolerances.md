Tolerances


1. If a non-originating material used in the production of a product does not satisfy the requirements set out in Annex 3-B, the product shall be considered as originating in a Party, provided that:

(a) for a product classified under Chapters 1 to 49 or Chapters 64 to 97 of the Harmonized System, the value of all those non-originating materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex- works or free on board price of the product; or

(b) for a product classified under Chapters 50 to 63 of the Harmonized System, tolerances apply as stipulated in Notes 6 to 8 of Annex 3-A.

2. Paragraph 1 does not apply if the value of non-originating materials used in the production of a product exceeds any of the percentages for the maximum value of non-originating materials as specified in the requirements set out in Annex 3-B.

3. Paragraph 1 does not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 3.3. If Annex 3-B requires that the materials used in the production of a product are wholly obtained, paragraphs 1 and 2 apply.
