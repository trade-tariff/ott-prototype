Sets


A set, classified pursuant to Rules 3(b) and (c) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System, shall be considered as originating in a Party when all of its components are originating under this Chapter. Where the set is composed of originating and non-originating components, it shall as a whole be considered as originating in a Party, provided that the value of the non-originating components does not exceed 15 per cent of the ex-works or free on board price of the set.
