Statement on origin


1. A statement on origin may be made out by an exporter of a product on the basis of information demonstrating that the product is originating, including information on the originating status of materials used in the production of the product. The exporter is responsible for the correctness of the statement on origin and of the information provided.

2. A statement on origin shall be made out using either of the linguistic versions of the text set out in Annex 3-E on an invoice or on any other commercial document that describes the originating product in sufficient detail to enable its identification. The importing Party shall not require the importer to submit a translation of the statement on origin.

3. The customs authority of the importing Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment due to minor errors or discrepancies in the statement on origin or for the sole reason that an invoice was issued in a third country.

4. A statement on origin shall be valid for:


(a) 12 months from the date on which it was made out or such longer period of time as provided by the importing Party, for a single shipment referred to in subparagraph 5(a); or

(b) 12 months from the date on which it was made out, for multiple shipments referred to in subparagraph 5(b).
 
5. A statement on origin may apply to:


(a) a single shipment of one or more products imported into a Party; or


(b) multiple shipments of identical products imported into a Party within any period specified in the statement on origin not exceeding 12 months.

6. If, on request of the importer, unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of Rule 2(a) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonized System are imported by instalments, a single statement on origin for such products may be used in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party.
