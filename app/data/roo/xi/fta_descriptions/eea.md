The European Economic Area (EEA) Agreement brings Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (EEA EFTA countries) into the EU's internal market, guaranteeing the freedom of movement for goods, services, people and capital, as well as unified related policies (competition, transport, energy, economic and monetary cooperation).

The same rules and conditions apply to all businesses within the EEA. EU legislation relating to the internal market is part of EEA countries' legislation.
