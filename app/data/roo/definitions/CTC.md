### Change in tariff classification (CTC)
Change in tariff classification (CTC) is one of the two main types of substantial transformation.

The CTC rule requires non-originating materials to have undergone a change in tariff classification on a required level in order to obtain originating status. The change in tariff classification can be required on a chapter, heading or subheading level HS Classification). It usually applies to all non-originating materials but can also apply to a specific type of material.

The CTC rule requires the exporter or producer to determine the classification of all non-originating inputs, materials and parts that are required to undergo a change in tariff classification. Only in that way will the exporter or producer be able to demonstrate that the change in classification has occurred.
