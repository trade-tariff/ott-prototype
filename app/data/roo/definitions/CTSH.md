### Change in tariff subheading (CTSH)
‘CTSH’ means production from non-originating materials of any subheading, except that of the product; this means that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a subheading (6-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in sub-heading).
