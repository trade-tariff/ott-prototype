### Accumulation

A good may be produced partly in the territory of one FTA partner, and completed in the territory of the other FTA partner.  A good may be made from materials produced by one producer from components produced by another producer.

To determine whether a good meets an HS classification change, treat all the production done in both countries as if it occurred in one, and treat the production done by all producers in the FTA region as if it were completed by one.
