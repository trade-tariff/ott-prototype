    <div class="govuk-details__text">
        'CTH' means production from non-originating materials of any heading, except that of the product; this means
        that any non-originating material used in the production of the product must be classified in a heading
        (4-digit level of the Harmonised System) other than that of the product (i.e. a change in heading).

                Orange marmalade is classified under heading 2007. Fresh oranges are classified under
                heading 0805. The specific rule of origin for orange marmalade requires a chapter change.
                If fresh oranges from overseas are transformed into orange marmalade in the UK,
                the orange marmalade is an originating good, because a change from chapter 08 to chapter 20
                has occurred.
