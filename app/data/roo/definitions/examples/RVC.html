    <div class="govuk-details__text">
        For a minority of goods, a specific rule of origin will require the good to meet an additional requirement to qualify as originating. Usually, this additional requirement tests the good’s regional value content (RVC), which requires that a certain percentage of the good’s value originates in an FTA country.
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
            <p class="b">Example</p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Some rules may specify that a good must have at least a 35% RVC based on the build-up method.
                To qualify for originating status under the FTA, therefore, importers have to demonstrate that
                at least 35% of the good’s value originated in the territory of the other party as determined
                using the build-up method.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                If a rule requires an HS classification change and an RVC test, the good has to meet both of
                these requirements to be an originating good.
