## Calculating regional value content
There are three methods of calculating the regional value content:
- the Build Down method
- the Build Up method _and_
- the Net Cost method (automotive goods only)
 
Unless specified in the rule, exporters or producers can choose the RVC method to be used.

### Build-down Method

RVC   =   ((AV - VNM) / AV) x  100

where:
- VC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage;
- AV is the adjusted value (the value for customs purposes), _and_   
- VNM is the value of non-originating materials that are acquired and used by the producer in the production of the good. 

VNM does not include the value of a material that is self-produced.

### Build-up Method
RVC   =     (VOM / AV)  x  100
where:
- RVC is the regional value content, expressed as a percentage;
- AV is the adjusted value (the value for customs purposes); _and_
- VOM is the value of originating materials that are acquired or self-produced, and used by the producer in the production of the good.
