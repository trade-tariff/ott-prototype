### UK / EU Trade and Co-operation Agreement

The UK moved to trading based on a new Free Trade Agreement (FTA) - the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) between the UK and the EU.

To import / export tariff-free under the TCA, goods must meet the UK-EU preferential rules of origin. This means that there must be a qualifying level of processing in the country of export to access zero tariffs. This applies to EU origin goods imported and moving through the UK from a Member State to another EU Member State, as well as goods imported from the Rest of World.

These rules are set out in the TCA and determine the origin of goods based on where the products or materials (or inputs) used in their production come from. Their purpose is to ensure that preferential tariffs are only given to goods that originate in the UK or EU and not from third countries (those apart from UK and the EU Member States).

#### Andorra and San Marino
Andorra and San Marino are part of customs unions with the EU. The UK has agreed with the EU that all products originating in San Marino and all non-agricultural products (chapters 25-97) originating in Andorra are to be treated as originating in the EU under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement as long as Andorra and San Marino apply to UK products the same preferences that the EU applies to them. These products benefit from zero tariffs, where they meet the relevant rules of origin. Trade with Andorra of agricultural products (chapters 01-24) is not in scope of the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement and takes place under WTO terms.
