The Developing Countries Trading Scheme (DCTS) replaced the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) on 19 June 2023. The government has introduced the DCTS to improve access to the UK market for developing countries.

The <abbr title="Developing Countries Trading Scheme">DCTS</abbr> aims to support sustainable growth in developing countries through a more generous unilateral offer.

This has led to provisions in the DCTS which:

- reduce tariffs
- liberalise rules of origin requirements
- simplify the conditions attached to the scheme

The DCTS applies to countries that currently benefit under the UKâ€™s GSP.

This includes:

- 47 countries in the GSP Least Developed Country (LDC) Framework
- 18 additional countries or territories classified by the World Bank as low income (LIC) and lower middle-income (LMIC)

It does not apply to countries classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income for 3 consecutive years, or to LICs and LMICs with a free trade agreement (FTA) with the UK.
