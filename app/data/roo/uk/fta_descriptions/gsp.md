###  Trading with developing nations

Eligible developing countries can get trade preferences through the UK Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP).

The UK GSP has 3 frameworks:

- Least Developed Countries Framework
- General Framework
- Enhanced Framework

### The UK GSP frameworks

### Least developed countries framework

This framework is for countries that the UN classifies as Least Developed Countries. Imports from these countries have quota-free access and nil rates of import duty on all goods other than arms and ammunition.

### General Framework

This framework is for countries that the World Bank classifies as low-income and lower-middle income countries. The following countries have signed trade agreements with the UK, however they may still receive GSP market access during the transition to their new trade arrangement.

- Kenya
- Ghana
- Jordan
- Vietnam

### Enhanced Framework

This framework is for countries that are:

- classified by the World Bank as low-income and lower-middle income countries
- economically vulnerable due to a lack of export diversification and a low level of integration with the international trading system

They must also implement 27 conventions relating to:

- human and labour rights
- the environment
- good governance
