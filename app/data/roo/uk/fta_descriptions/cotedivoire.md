### UK-Côte d'Ivoire Stepping Stone Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)

The UK has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Côte d’Ivoire, which is in effect.

EPAs are principally development-focused trade agreements that aim to promote increased trade and investment. They contribute to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

### What the agreement covers

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from Côte d’Ivoire.

In exchange, Côte d’Ivoire commits to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in Côte d’Ivoire are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

This EPA includes provisions on:

- trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs, rules of origin and sanitary and phytosanitary measures
