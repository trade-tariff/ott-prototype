The UK signed a free trade agreement with New Zealand on 28 February 2022. Negotiations were launched on 17 June 2020.

The agreement is not yet in force. Both the UK and New Zealand are required to complete their respective domestic procedures for the agreement to come into effect. Once approved by both parliaments, businesses will be able to trade under its terms.
