### UK-Cameroon economic partnership agreement (EPA)

The UK has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Cameroon, which is in force.

EPAs are principally development-focused trade agreements that aim to promote increased trade and investment. They contribute to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

### What the agreement includes

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from Cameroon.

In exchange, Cameroon commits to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in Cameroon are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

This EPA includes provisions on:

- trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs, customs and rules of origin
- sanitary and phytosanitary measures
- technical barriers to trade
- trade remedies
