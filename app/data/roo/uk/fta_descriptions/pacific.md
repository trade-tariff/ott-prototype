### UK-Pacific States Economic Partnership Agreement

The UK has signed an interim Economic Partnership Agreement (iEPA) with the Pacific States, which is in effect.

The Pacific States covered by this agreement are:

- Fiji
- Papua New Guinea

Samoa and the Solomon Islands have not yet acceded to the agreement (pending a decision on their accession), however preferences under the iEPA have taken effect through a Memorandum of Understanding.

### What the agreement covers

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from the Pacific States.

In exchange, the Pacific States commit to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in the Pacific States are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

This EPA includes provisions on:

- trade in goods (including provisions on preferential tariffs and rules of origin)
