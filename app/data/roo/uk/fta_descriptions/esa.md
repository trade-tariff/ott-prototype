### ESA-UK economic partnership agreement (EPA)

The UK has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with some Eastern and Southern African (ESA) states, which is in effect. An economic partnership agreement (EPA) is a type of free trade agreement for relationships with developing countries.

The states covered by the ESA-UK EPA are:

- Mauritius
- Seychelles
- Zimbabwe

The following ESA states will be covered by the EPA if they sign it and bring it into effect:

- Madagascar
- Comoros
- Zambia

### What the agreement covers

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from the ESA states.

In exchange, the ESA states commit to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in the ESA states are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

This EPA includes provisions on:

- trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs, tariff rate quotas and rules of origin
- trade in services
- government procurement
