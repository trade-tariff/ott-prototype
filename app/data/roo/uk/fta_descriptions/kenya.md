### UK-Kenya Economic Partnership Agreement

The UK has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the Republic of Kenya, which is in effect.

EPAs are principally development-focused trade agreements that aim to promote increased trade and investment. They contribute to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from Kenya.

In exchange, Kenya commits to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in Kenya are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

### What the agreement covers

This EPA includes provisions on:

- trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs and rules of origin
