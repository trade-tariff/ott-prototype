### SACUM-UK Economic Partnership Agreement

The UK has signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the Southern African Customs Union Member States (SACU) and Mozambique (SACUM), which is in effect.

The SACUM countries covered by this agreement are:

- Botswana
- Eswatini (formerly Swaziland)
- Lesotho
- Mozambique
- Namibia
- South Africa

EPAs are principally development-focused trade agreements that aim to promote increased trade and investment. They contribute to sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries.

### What the agreement covers

The UK commits to providing immediate duty-free, quota-free access to goods exported from the SACU Member States and Mozambique, except for South Africa.

In exchange, the SACU Member States and Mozambique commit to gradual tariff liberalisation of goods. Some domestically sensitive products in the SACU Member States and Mozambique are excluded from tariff liberalisation.

This EPA includes provisions on:

- trade in goods - including provisions on preferential tariffs, tariff rate quotas, rules of origin and sanitary and phytosanitary measures
- intellectual property, including geographical indications
