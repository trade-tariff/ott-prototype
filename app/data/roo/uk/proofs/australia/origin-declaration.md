A declaration of origin: 

(a) need not follow a prescribed format; 

(b) must be in writing, including electronic format;

(c) must specify that the good is both originating and meets the requirements of this Origin Reference Document;

(d) must be attached to, or provided on, an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified; and
 
(e) must fulfil the data requirements as set out in Annex I (Data Requirements) - see below.

A declaration of origin may apply to:

(a) a single shipment of a good into the territory of a Party; or

(b) multiple shipments of identical goods within any period specified in the declaration of origin, but not exceeding 12 months.

A declaration of origin is valid for one year after the date that it was completed or for such longer period specified by the laws and regulations of the importing Party. 
 
If unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of rule 2(a) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonized System 2017 are imported by more than one shipment, a single declaration of origin for such products may be used on request of the importer and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party.

If a producer declares the origin of a good, the declaration of origin must be completed on the basis of the producer having information that the good is originating.

If the exporter is not the producer of the good, a declaration of origin may be completed by the exporter of the good on the basis of:

(a) the exporter having information that the good is originating; or 

(b) the exporter placing reasonable reliance on the producer’s information that the good is originating.

If an importer of the good makes a claim for preferential tariff treatment on the basis of the importer’s knowledge the good is originating, the claim is made on the basis of: 

(a) the importer having documentation that the good is originating; or

(b) the importer placing reasonable reliance on supporting documentation provided by the exporter or producer that the good is originating.
