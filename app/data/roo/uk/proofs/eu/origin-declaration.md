A statement on origin is needed if the exporter exports consignments with a total value of more than £5,500 / 6,000 euros.

In the UK, the exporter’s reference number will be the EORI number. If you do not have one, you can [apply for an EORI number](https://www.gov.uk/eori). In the EU, the exporter’s reference number will be the exporter’s registered exporter (REX) number.

Statements on origin are also known as origin declarations. Find out more about using [origin declarations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-proof-of-origin-for-your-goods#origin-declaration).
