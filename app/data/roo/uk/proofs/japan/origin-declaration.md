Goods do not require a statement of origin if they are:

- entering Japan from the UK and below 200,000 yen in value
- entering the UK from Japan and below £1,000 in value.

In the UK, the exporter’s reference number will be the EORI number. If you do not have one, you can [apply for an EORI number](https://www.gov.uk/eori). 

Statements on origin are also known as origin declarations. Find out more about using [origin declarations](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-proof-of-origin-for-your-goods#origin-declaration).
