#### Procedure for issuing of a movement certificate EUR.1

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting Party on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter’s responsibility, by his authorised representative.

2. For that purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill in both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Annex IV to this Origin Reference Document. Those forms shall be completed in an official language of a Party and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting Party. If the completion of the forms is done in handwriting, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products shall be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party where the movement certificate EUR.1 is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting Party if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

5. The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document. For that purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter’s accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in Box 11 of the movement certificate EUR.1.

7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

#### Electronically issued movement certificates EUR.1

1. As an alternative to the provisions regarding the issuance of movement certificates, the Parties shall accept electronically issued movement certificates EUR.1. Considering the digitalised system to issue movement certificates EUR.1, the formal requirements of electronically issued movement certificates EUR.1 are stated in paragraph 3. 

2. The Parties shall inform each other about the readiness of the issuance of electronic movement certificates EUR.1 and all technical issues related to such implementation (issuance, submission and verification of an electronic certificate).

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Annex IV shall not apply if the movement certificate is issued and validated electronically, and the following applies: 

    (a) ink stamps used by the customs or competent governmental authorities for the validation of the movement certificate EUR.1 (Box 11) may be replaced with an image or electronic stamps;

    (b) Boxes 11 and 12 may contain facsimile or electronic signatures instead of original signatures; 

    (c) the information in Box 11 concerning the form and number of the export document shall be indicated only where requested by the domestic legislation of the exporting Party;

    (d) it shall bear a serial number or a code by which it can be identified; and

    (e) it may be issued in any of the official languages of the Parties or in English.

#### Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 20(8), a movement certificate EUR.1 may be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

    (a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances;

    (b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons;

    (c) the final destination of the products concerned was not known at the time of exportation and was determined during their transportation or storage and after possible splitting of consignments in accordance with Article 14(3);

    (d) a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR.MED was issued in accordance with the rules of the PEM Convention for products that are also originating in accordance with this Origin Reference Document; the exporter shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the conditions to apply cumulation are fulfilled and be prepared to submit to the customs authorities all relevant documents proving that the product is originating in accordance with this Origin Reference Document; or

    (e) a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued on the basis of Article 8(5) and the application of Article 8(4) is required at importation in any country referred to in Annex VIII.

2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for his request.

3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively within two years from the date of exportation and only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter’s application complies with that in the corresponding file.

4. In addition to the requirement under Article 20(3), movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase: “ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY”.

5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the movement certificate EUR.1.

#### Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. In addition to the requirement under Article 20(3), the duplicate issued in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be endorsed with the following word: “DUPLICATE”.

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.

4. The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.
