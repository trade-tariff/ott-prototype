#### Procedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.

2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill in both the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED and the application form, specimens of which appear in the Annexes IIIa and b to this Origin Reference Document. These forms shall be completed in one of the languages in which the UK-Israel Agreement is drawn up and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the forms are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products shall be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting country where the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. Without prejudice to paragraph 5, a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of the UK in the following cases:

— if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Israel, without application of cumulation with materials originating in Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Turkey or one of the countries referred to in Articles 3(2) and 4(2), and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document, or

— if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 with which cumulation is applicable, without application of cumulation with materials originating in one of the countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4, and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document, provided a certificate EUR-MED or an invoice declaration EUR-MED has been issued in the country of origin.

5. A movement certificate EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities of the UK or of Israel if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK, in Israel or in one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4 with which cumulation is applicable, fulfil the requirements of this Origin Reference Document and:

— cumulation was applied with materials originating in Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Turkey or one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3(2) and 4(2), or

— the products may be used as materials in the context of cumulation for the manufacture of products for export to one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4, or

— the products may be re-exported from the country of destination to one of the other countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4.

6. A movement certificate EUR-MED shall contain one of the following statements in English in Box 7:

— if origin has been obtained by application of cumulation with materials originating in one or more of the countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4:

‘CUMULATION APPLIED WITH …’ (name of the country/countries)

— if origin has been obtained without the application of cumulation with materials originating in one or more of the countries referred to in Articles 3 and 4:

‘NO CUMULATION APPLIED’

7. The customs authorities issuing movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document. For this purpose, they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. They shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

8. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be indicated in Box 11 of the certificate.

9. A movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

#### Movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 17(9), a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

(a)  it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or

(b)  it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

2. Notwithstanding Article 17(9), a movement certificate EUR-MED may be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates and for which a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued at the time of exportation, provided that it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that the conditions referred to in Article 17(5) are satisfied.

3. For the implementation of paragraphs 1 and 2, the exporter shall indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED relates, and state the reasons for his request.

4. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application complies with that in the corresponding file.

5. Movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase in English:

    ‘ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY’

    Movement certificates EUR-MED issued retrospectively by application of paragraph 2 shall be endorsed with the following phrase in English:

#### Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate issued in this way shall be endorsed with the following word in English:

    ‘DUPLICATE’

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in Box 7 of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED.

4. The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED, shall take effect as from that date.

#### Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously

When originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in the UK or in Israel, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED for the purpose of sending all or some of these products elsewhere within the UK or Israel. The replacement movement certificate(s) EUR.1 or EUR-MED shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.
