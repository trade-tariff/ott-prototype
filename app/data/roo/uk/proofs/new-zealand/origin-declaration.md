1. An origin declaration does not need to follow a prescribed format, provided it contains all minimum data elements identified in Annex I (Origin Declarations â€“ Guidance).

2. An origin declaration may be provided on, or attached to, an invoice or other commercial document issued in the exporting Party that contains some of the required minimum data elements, provided all the minimum data elements are included on or with the origin declaration.

3. An origin declaration shall be valid for at least 12 months from the date it was completed or for a longer period as provided by the importing Party.

For any originating good imported into the territory of a Party on or after the date of entry into force of the United Kingdom-New Zealand Agreement, the customs authority of the importing Party shall accept an origin declaration that has been completed and signed prior to the date of entry into force by the exporter or producer of that good.

6. If unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonized System 2017 are imported in instalments, a single origin declaration for those products may be used on request of the importer and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party.

### Waiver of Origin Documentation

1. An importer, exporter or producer shall not be required to present an origin declaration as specified in Article 18 (Origin Declaration) in respect of:

    (a) an importation of a good whose customs value does not exceed 2,000 New Zealand dollars for goods imported in New Zealand, or 1,000 United Kingdom pounds for goods imported into the United Kingdom, or such higher amount as the importing Party may establish; *or*

    (b) an importation of a good into the territory of the importing Party for which the importing Party has waived the requirement for an origin declaration.

2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to an importation when the customs authority of the importing Party reasonably considers that the importation is part of a series of importations that have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this Origin Reference Document related to origin declarations.
