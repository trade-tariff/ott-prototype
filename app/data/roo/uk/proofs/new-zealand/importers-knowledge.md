An importer may make a claim for preferential tariff treatment based on the importer's knowledge that a product is originating. Such claims shall be made by the importer of the good on the basis of:

(a)	the importer having documentation demonstrating that the good is originating; or

(b)	reasonable reliance on supporting documentation provided by the exporter or producer that the good is originating.

If a claim is based on importer's knowledge, an importer that becomes aware or has reason to believe that the importer's knowledge and supporting documentation for a good which it has imported, and to which preferential treatment has been granted, contains incorrect information shall immediately notify the customs authority of the importing Party in writing of any change affecting the originating status of that good and pay any duties owing.
