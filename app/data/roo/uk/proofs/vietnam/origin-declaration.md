An 'origin declaration', given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. The text of the invoice declaration appears in Appendix 4 of the [origin reference document](ord).

In the UK, the exporterâ€™s reference number will be the EORI number. If you do not have one, you can [apply for an EORI number](https://www.gov.uk/eori).

#### Conditions for Making out an Origin Declaration

1. An origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Viet Nam and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

2. The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the competent authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter on the invoice, the delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient details to enable them to be identified, by typing, stamping or printing on that document the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex VI to this Origin Reference Document,  in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting Party. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in capital characters.

4. Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 20 (Approved Exporter) shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the competent authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.

5. An origin declaration may be made out after exportation provided that it is presented in the importing Party no later than two years, or the period specified in the legislation of the importing Party, after the entry of the goods into the territory.

6. The conditions for making out an origin declaration referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5 apply mutatis mutandis to statements of origin made out by an exporter registered as provided for in subparagraphs 1(c) and 2(c) of Article 15 (General Requirements). 

#### Approved Exporter

1. The competent authorities of the exporting Party may authorise any exporter (hereinafter referred to as "approved exporter") who exports products under the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned. An exporter seeking such authorisation shall offer to the satisfaction of the competent authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

2. The competent authorities may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions specified in domestic legislation which they consider appropriate.

3. The competent authorities shall grant to the approved exporter an authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.

4. The competent authorities shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.

5. The competent authorities may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so when the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.
