## Using a Form A

[Form A](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completing-generalised-scheme-of-preferences-form-a) must bear a serial number, printed or otherwise, or, where there is no serial number, a reference to the commercial invoice by which it can be identified does not need to be stamped and signed by an authority designated by the beneficiary country, so does not need to be an original 

### Box 1
Enter the full name and business address of the exporter. 

### Box 2 Consignee
The completion of this box is optional, but you are recommended to enter the name and address of the consignee where this is known. For exports to exhibitions which are later sent on to the UK, insert also the name and address of the exhibition.

### Box 3 Transport details 
You should complete this box on the basis of available information. If you do not have details of the transport arrangements, then leave this box blank.

### Box 4 For official use
This box is reserved for the use of the certifying authority. However, if the Form A has been made out after the goods have been shipped, stamp or write “Issued Retrospectively”.

### Box 5 Item number
If different types of goods are shown separately on the invoice(s), show each type separately on the Form A and itemise them (1, 2, 3 etc), so they can be cross-checked to the invoice if necessary. 

### Box 6 Marks and numbers
Enter the identifying marks and numbers that appear on the packages. If the packages are marked with the address of the consignee, state the address. If they are not marked in any way, put 'No marks and numbers'. If both originating and non-originating goods are packed together, add 'Part contents only' at the end of each entry.

### Box 7 Number and kind of packages, description of goods

**Bulk Goods**

Identify the goods by giving a reasonably full commercial description e.g. 'photocopiers' or 'typewriters' rather than 'office machinery'. However, if the invoices give full identifying details (which need not necessarily include details of the marks and numbers of the packages) only a general description is needed.

For goods in bulk which are not individually packed, insert 'In bulk'. The quantity shown must be the same as, or relatable to, the quantity shown on the invoice for the goods (e.g. if the invoice shows 100 cartons and these are loaded on to 10 pallets, specify '100 cartons' NOT '10 pallets'). 

**Mixed consignments**

For consignments containing both originating and non-originating goods, describe only the originating goods on the Form A. You may be unable to avoid showing originating and non- originating goods on the same invoice. In this case, mark the invoice (for example, with an asterisk) to show which goods are non-originating and put an appropriate statement in Box 7 immediately below the description of the goods, e.g. 'Goods marked * on the invoice are non-originating and are not covered by this Form A'.

The same considerations will apply if you have a mixed consignment of goods qualifying by virtue of a derogation and others which are not covered by that derogation. 

**Unused space**

Draw a horizontal line under the final item in this box and rule through the unused space with a 'Z-shaped' line.

### Box 8 Origin criterion

This box signifies to HMRC which origin rule has been applied to the goods. 

As described in the note about it on the reverse of the Form A, enter the code:

- “P” for wholly obtained goods *and* 

- “W”, followed by the heading, where the goods have been sufficiently processed

For example: for wholly obtained goods of, say, heading 96.18, the indication should read: "P" and for sufficiently processed goods of the same heading, it should read: "W” 96.18. 

Failure to complete this box correctly could lead to the rejection of the Form A. 

### Box 9 Gross weight or other quantity

Insert the quantity in metric units (e.g. kilograms, litres etc).  

### Box 10 Number and date of invoice

You are recommended to enter the details of the commercial invoice as this ensures the signatory has verified the ex-works price.  

### Box 11 Certification

This field may be left blank. The UK no longer requires the Form A to be certified by a designated authority in the exporting DCTS country.

### Box 12 Declaration by the exporter

Complete this box by inserting the name of the country in which the goods are considered to have originated. You should take into account that where the provisions for regional cumulation have been applied, that country may not be the same as the country of final processing or the country of exportation.

For the importing country you must put 'United Kingdom'; indicating a different importing country (e.g., European Union) will lead to the Form A not being accepted. Only the exporter, or a person duly authorised by the exporter, can sign this declaration. Forwarding agents acting simply in that capacity are not exporters and must not sign this box. By signing this form, you declare that the goods qualify under the provisions of the Trade Preference Scheme (Developing Countries Trading Scheme) Regulations 2023 and the Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Developing Countries Trading Scheme)) Regulations 2023.

If the declaration is incorrect, you will have committed an offence which may incur penalties.
