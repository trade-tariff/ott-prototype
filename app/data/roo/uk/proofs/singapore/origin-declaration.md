2. An origin declaration may be made out if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in the UK or in Singapore and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared at all times to submit, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents as referred to under Article 23 (Supporting Documents) proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery Note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex E to this Origin Reference Document, in accordance with the domestic law of the exporting Party. If the declaration is hand-written, it shall be written in ink in capital characters in English.

5. Origin declarations shall bear the original signature of the exporter in manuscript. An approved exporter as referred to in Article 18 (Approved Exporter) shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him.

#### Approved Exporter

1. The customs authorities of the UK may authorise any exporter who exports products under the United Kingdom-Singapore Agreement to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned (hereinafter referred to as "approved exporter"). An exporter seeking such authorisation must offer to the satisfaction of the customs authorities all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

2. The customs authorities of the UK may grant the status of approved exporter subject to any conditions which they consider appropriate.

3. The customs authorities of the UK shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.

4. The customs authorities of the UK shall monitor the use of the authorisation by the approved exporter.

5. The customs authorities of the UK may withdraw the authorisation at any time. They shall do so where the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 1, no longer fulfils the conditions referred to in paragraph 2 or otherwise makes an incorrect use of the authorisation.

#### Validity of Origin Declaration

1. An origin declaration shall be valid for twelve months from the date of issue in the exporting Party. Preferential tariff treatment shall be claimed within such period to the customs authorities of the importing Party.

2. Origin declarations which are submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party after the final date for presentation specified in paragraph 1 may be accepted for the purposes of applying preferential treatment, where the failure to submit these documents by the final date set is due to exceptional circumstances.

3. In cases of belated presentation other than those of paragraph 2, the customs authorities of the importing Party may accept the origin declarations where the products have been submitted before such final date.

#### Submission of Origin Declaration

For the purposes of claiming preferential tariff treatment, origin declarations shall be submitted to the customs authorities of the importing Party in accordance with the procedures applicable in that Party.

#### Importation in Instalments

Where, at the request of the importer and on the conditions laid down by the customs authorities of the importing Party, dismantled or non-assembled products within the meaning of paragraph 2(a) of Part Two, Section 1, of the Tariff of the United Kingdom falling within Sections XVI and XVII or headings 7308 and 9406 of HS 2017 are imported in instalments, a single origin declaration for such products shall be submitted to the customs authorities upon importation of the first instalment.

Products which are sent as small packages from private persons to private persons, or which form part of travellers' personal luggage, shall be admitted as originating products without requiring the submission of an origin declaration, provided that such products are not imported by way of trade and have been declared as meeting the requirements of this Origin Reference Document, and provided that there is no doubt as to the veracity of such a declaration. In the case of products sent by post, this declaration can be made on the customs declaration CN22/CN23 or on a sheet of paper annexed to that document.

2. Imports which are occasional and consist solely of products for the personal use of the recipients or of travellers or their families shall not be considered as imports by way of trade if it is evident from the nature and quantity of the products that no commercial purpose is intended.

3. The total value of these products shall not exceed 500 euro in the case of small packages or 1 200 euro in the case of products forming part of travellers' personal luggage.
