#### Procedure for the issue of an EUR.1 movement certificate

1. An EUR.1 movement certificate shall be issued by the customs authorities or the competent governmental authority of the exporting country on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by his authorised representative.

2. For this purpose, the exporter or his authorised representative shall fill out both the EUR.1 movement certificate and the application form, specimens of which appear in Appendix III. These forms shall be completed in English or Spanish and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law of the exporting country. If they are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products must be given in the box reserved for this purpose without leaving any lines blank. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line must be drawn below the last line of the description and the empty space must be crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of an EUR.1 movement certificate shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities or the competent governmental authority of the exporting country where the EUR.1 movement certificate is issued, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. An EUR.1 movement certificate shall be issued by the customs authorities or competent governmental authority if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in Mexico or the United Kingdom and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

5. The issuing customs authorities or the competent governmental authority shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document. For this purpose, they shall have the right to request any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities or competent governmental authority shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issue of the EUR.1 movement certificate shall be indicated in box 11 of the certificate.

7. An EUR.1 movement certificate shall be issued by the customs authority or the competent governmental authority and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

#### EUR.1 movement certificates issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 16(7), an EUR.1 movement certificate may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

    (a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances, or

    (b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities or the competent governmental authority that an EUR.1 movement certificate was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter must indicate in his application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the EUR.1 movement certificate relates, and state the reasons for his request.

3. The customs authorities or the competent governmental authority may issue an EUR.1 movement certificate retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application agrees with that in the corresponding file, and will be accepted by the customs authority of the importing country, in accordance with the domestic law of each Party, as set out under Appendix V.

4. EUR.1 movement certificates issued retrospectively must be endorsed with one of the following phrases:

    ES 'EXPEDIDO A POSTERIORI',

    EN 'ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY'

5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in the 'Remarks' box of the EUR.1 movement certificate.

#### Issue of a duplicate EUR.1 movement certificate

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of an EUR.1 movement certificate, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities or the competent governmental authority which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate issued in this way must be endorsed with one of the following words:

    ES  ‘DUPLICADO’

    EN  ‘DUPLICATE’

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in the 'Remarks' box of the duplicate EUR.1 movement certificate.

4. The duplicate, which must bear the date of issue of the original EUR.1 movement certificate, shall take effect as from that date.

#### Issue of EUR.1 movement certificates on the basis of proof of origin issued or made out previously

1. It shall at any time be possible to replace one or more EUR.1 movement certificates by one or more other certificates provided that this is done by the customs office or the competent governmental authority responsible for controlling the goods.

2. The replacement certificate shall be regarded as a definitive EUR.1 movement certificate for the purpose of the application of this Origin Reference Document, including the provisions of this Article.

3. The replacement certificate shall be issued on the basis of a written request from the re-exporter, after the authorities concerned have verified the information supplied in the applicant's request.
