#### Procedure for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1

1. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of Cameroon on application having been made in writing by the exporter or, under the exporter's responsibility, by the authorised representative of the exporter.

2. For that purpose, the exporter or the authorised representative of the exporter shall fill out both the movement certificate EUR.1 and the application form, specimens of which appear in Appendix 3. Those forms shall be completed in accordance with the provisions of Part A of this Origin Reference Document. If they are handwritten, they shall be completed in ink in printed characters. The description of the products shall be given in the box reserved for that purpose without leaving any blank lines. Where the box is not completely filled, a horizontal line shall be drawn below the last line of the description, the empty space being crossed through.

3. The exporter applying for the issue of a movement certificate EUR.1 shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of Cameroon, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of Part A of this Origin Reference Document.

4. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities of Cameroon if the products concerned can be considered as products originating in Cameroon or in one of the other countries or territories referred to in Article 6, and fulfil the other requirements of Part A of this Origin Reference Document.

5. The issuing customs authorities shall take any steps necessary to verify the originating status of the products and the fulfilment of the other requirements of Part A of this Origin Reference Document. For that purpose they shall have the right to call for any evidence and to carry out any inspection of the exporter's accounts or any other check considered appropriate. The issuing customs authorities shall also ensure that the forms referred to in paragraph 2 are duly completed. In particular, they shall check whether the space reserved for the description of the products has been completed in such a manner as to exclude all possibility of fraudulent additions.

6. The date of issue of the movement certificate EUR.1 shall be indicated in box 11 of the certificate.

7. A movement certificate EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs authorities and made available to the exporter as soon as actual exportation has been effected or ensured.

#### Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively

1. Notwithstanding Article 15(7), a movement certificate EUR.1 may exceptionally be issued after exportation of the products to which it relates if:

    (a) it was not issued at the time of exportation because of errors or involuntary omissions or special circumstances; or

    (b) it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the customs authorities that a movement certificate EUR.1 was issued but was not accepted at importation for technical reasons.

2. For the implementation of paragraph 1, the exporter shall indicate in the application the place and date of exportation of the products to which the movement certificate EUR.1 relates, and state the reasons for that request.

3. The customs authorities may issue a movement certificate EUR.1 retrospectively only after verifying that the information supplied in the exporter's application complies with that in the corresponding file.

4. Movement certificates EUR.1 issued retrospectively shall be endorsed with the following phrase:

    'ISSUED RETROSPECTIVELY'

5. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 4 shall be inserted in box 7 of the movement certificate EUR.1.

#### Issue of a duplicate movement certificate EUR.1

1. In the event of theft, loss or destruction of a movement certificate EUR.1, the exporter may apply to the customs authorities which issued it for a duplicate made out on the basis of the export documents in their possession.

2. The duplicate issued in this way shall be endorsed with the following word:

    'DUPLICATE'

3. The endorsement referred to in paragraph 2 shall be inserted in box 7 of the duplicate movement certificate EUR.1.

4. The duplicate, which shall bear the date of issue of the original movement certificate EUR.1, shall take effect as from that date.

#### Issue of movement certificates EUR.1 on the basis of a proof of origin issued or made out previously

When originating products are placed under the control of a customs office in Cameroon or in the United Kingdom, it shall be possible to replace the original proof of origin by one or more movement certificates EUR.1 for the purpose of sending all or some of those products elsewhere within Cameroon or within the United Kingdom. The replacement movement certificate or certificates EUR.1 shall be issued by the customs office under whose control the products are placed.
