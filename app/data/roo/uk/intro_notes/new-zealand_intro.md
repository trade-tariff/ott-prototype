# Headnotes to the Annex

1. The Product Specific Rule, or product specific set of rules, that applies to a particular subheading is set out immediately adjacent to the subheading, heading, or chapter, as applicable.

2. The Product Specific Rules in this Annex are structured on the basis of the nomenclature of the Harmonized System in January 2017, including its General Interpretative Rules, Section Notes, and Chapter Notes.

3. Where a tariff heading or subheading is subject to alternative product specific rules, it shall be sufficient to comply with one of the rules.

4. A requirement of a change in tariff classification applies only to non-originating materials.

5. Where the change in tariff classification rule expressly excludes a change from other tariff classifications, the exclusion applies only to non-originating materials.

6. Section, chapter, or heading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning of each section, chapter, or heading, and are read in conjunction with the product specific rules of origin and may impose further conditions, or provide an alternative product specific rule of origin.

7. For the purposes of this Annex:

- (a) “section” means a section of the Harmonized System 2017;
