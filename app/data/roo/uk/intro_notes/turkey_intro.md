### Note 1 - General introduction

The list sets out the conditions required for all products to be considered as sufficiently worked or processed within the meaning of Article 6 of this Protocol. There are four different types of rule, which vary according to the product:

- through working or processing a maximum content of non-originating materials is not exceeded;

- through working or processing the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit Harmonized System sub-heading of the manufactured products becomes different from the 4-digit Harmonized System heading or 6-digit sub-heading respectively of the materials used;

- a specific working and processing operation is carried out;

- working or processing is carried out on certain wholly obtained materials.

### Note 2 - The structure of the list

1. The first two columns in the list describe the product obtained. Column (1) gives the heading number or chapter number used in the Harmonized System and column (2) gives the description of goods used in that system for that heading or chapter. For each entry in the first two columns, a rule is specified in column (3). Where, in some cases, the entry in column (1) is preceded by an "ex", this signifies that the rules in column (3) apply only to the part of that heading as described in column (2).

2. Where several heading numbers are grouped together in column (1) or a chapter number is given and the description of products in column (2) is therefore given in general terms, the adjacent rules in column (3) apply to all products which, under the Harmonized System, are classified in headings of the chapter or in any of the headings grouped together in column (1).

3. Where there are different rules in the list applying to different products within a heading, each indent contains the description of that part of the heading covered by the adjacent rules in column (3).

4. Where two alternative rules are set out in column (3), separated by "or", it is at the choice of the exporter which one to use.

### Note 3 - Examples of how to apply the rules

1. Article 6 of this Protocol, concerning products having acquired originating status which are used in the manufacture of other products, shall apply, regardless of whether this status has been acquired inside the factory where these products are used or in another factory in a Party.

2. Pursuant to Article 8 of this Protocol, the working or processing carried out must go beyond the list of operations mentioned in that Article. If it does not, the goods shall not qualify for the granting of the benefit of preferential tariff treatment, even if the conditions set out in the list below are met.

    Subject to Article 8 of this Protocol, the rules in the list represent the minimum amount of working or processing required, and the carrying-out of more working or processing also confers originating status; conversely, the carrying-out of less working or processing cannot confer originating status. Thus, if a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may be used, the use of such material at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of such material at a later stage is not. If a rule provides that non-originating material, at a certain level of manufacture, may not be used, the use of materials at an earlier stage of manufacture is allowed, and the use of materials at a later stage is not.

    Example: when the list-rule for Chapter 19 requires that “non-originating materials of headings 1101 to 1108 cannot exceed 20% weight”, the use (i.e. importation) of cereals of Chapter 10 (materials at an earlier stage of manufacture) is not limited.

3. Without prejudice to Note 3.2, where a rule uses the expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading", then materials of any heading(s) (even materials of the same description and heading as the product) may be used, subject, however, to any specific limitations which may also be contained in the rule.

    However, the expression "Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of heading ..." or "Manufacture from materials of any heading, including other materials of the same heading as the product" means that materials of any heading(s) may be used, except those of the same description as the product as given in column (2) of the list.

4. When a rule in the list specifies that a product may be manufactured from more than one material, this means that one or more materials may be used. It does not require that all be used.

5. Where a rule in the list specifies that a product must be manufactured from a particular material, the condition does not prevent the use of other materials which, because of their inherent nature, cannot satisfy this.

6. Where, in a rule in the list, two percentages are given for the maximum value of non-originating materials that can be used, then these percentages may not be added together. In other words, the maximum value of all the non-originating materials used may never exceed the higher of the percentages given. Furthermore, the individual percentages must not be exceeded, in relation to the particular materials to which they apply.

### Note 4 - General provisions concerning certain agricultural goods

1. Agricultural goods falling within Chapters 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and heading 2401 which are grown or harvested in the territory of a Party shall be treated as originating in the territory of that Party, even if grown from imported seeds, bulbs, rootstock, cuttings, grafts, shoots, buds, or other live parts of plants.

2. In cases where the content of non-originating sugar in a given product is subject to limitations, the weight of sugars of headings 1701 (sucrose) and 1702 (e.g., fructose, glucose, lactose, maltose, isoglucose or invert sugar) used in the manufacture of the final product and used in the manufacture of the non-originating products incorporated in the final product is taken into account for the calculation of such limitations.

### Note 5 - Terminology used in respect of certain textile products

1. The term "natural fibres" is used in the list to refer to fibres other than artificial or synthetic fibres. It is restricted to the stages before spinning takes place, including waste, and, unless otherwise specified, includes fibres which have been carded, combed or otherwise processed, but not spun.

2. The term "natural fibres" includes horsehair of heading 0511, silk of headings 5002 and 5003, as well as wool-fibres and fine or coarse animal hair of headings 5101 to 5105, cotton fibres of headings 5201 to 5203, and other vegetable fibres of headings 5301 to 5305.

3. The terms "textile pulp", "chemical materials" and "paper-making materials" are used in the list to describe the materials, not classified in Chapters 50 to 63, which can be used to manufacture artificial, synthetic or paper fibres or yarns.

4. The term "man-made staple fibres" is used in the list to refer to synthetic or artificial filament tow, staple fibres or waste, of headings 5501 to 5507.

5. Printing (when combined with Weaving, Knitting/Crocheting, Tufting or Flocking) is defined as a technique by which an objectively assessed function, like colour, design, technical performance, is given to a textile substrate with a permanent character, using screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques.

6. Printing (as standalone operation) is defined as a technique by which an objectively assessed function, like colour, design, technical performance, is given to a textile substrate with a permanent character, using screen, roller, digital or transfer techniques combined with at least two preparatory/finishing operations (such as scouring, bleaching, mercerizing, heat setting, raising, calendaring, shrink resistance processing, permanent finishing, decatising, impregnating, mending and burling), provided that the value of all the materials used does not exceed 50% of the ex-works price of the product.

### Note 6 - Tolerances applicable to products made of a mixture of textile materials

1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column (3) shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent 15% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 6.3 and 6.4).

### Note 7 - Other tolerances applicable to certain textile products

1. Where, in the list, reference is made to this Note, textile materials (with the exception of linings and interlinings), which do not satisfy the rule set out in the list in column 3 for the made-up product concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the product and that their value does not exceed 15% of the ex-works price of the product.

2. Without prejudice to Note 6.3, materials, which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63, may be used freely in the manufacture of textile products, whether or not they contain textiles.

3. Where a percentage rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.

### Note 8 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of Chapter 27

    7. polymerisation;
    8. alkylation;
    9. isomerisation.

2. For the purposes of headings 2710, 2711 and 2712, the "specific processes" are the following:

3. For the purposes of headings ex 2707 and 2713, simple operations, such as cleaning, decanting, desalting, water separation, filtering, colouring, marking, obtaining a sulphur content as a result of mixing products with different sulphur contents, or any combination of these operations or like operations, do not confer origin.

### Note 9 - Definition of specific processes and simple operations carried out in respect of certain products of chapters

1. Products falling within Chapter 30 obtained in a Party by using cell cultures, shall be considered as originating in that Party. "Cell culture" is defined as the cultivation of human, animal and plant cells under controlled conditions (such as defined temperatures, growth medium, gas mixture, pH) outside a living organism.

2. Products falling within Chapters 29 (except for: 2905.43-2905.44), 30, 32, 33 (except for: 3302.10, 3301) 34, 35 (except for: 35.01, 3502.11-3502.19, 3502.20, 35.05), 36, 37, 38 (except for: 3809.10, 38.23, 3824.60, 38.26) and 39 (except for: 39.16-39.26): obtained in a Party by fermentation shall be considered as originating in that Party. "Fermentation" is a biotechnological process in which human, animal, plant cells, bacteria, yeasts, fungi or enzymes are used to produce products falling within Chapters 29 to 39.

3. Following transformations are considered sufficient according to Article 4 for products falling within Chapters 28, 29 (except for: 2905.43-2905.44), 30, 32, 33 (except for: 3302.10, 3301) 34, 35 (except for: 35.01, 3502.11-3502.19, 3502.20, 35.05), 36, 37, 38 (except for: 3809.10, 38.23, 3824.60, 38.26) and 39 (except for: 39.16-39.26):

    (a) Chemical reaction: A “chemical reaction” is a process (including a biochemical process) which results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds, or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. A chemical reaction may be expressed by a change of the "CAS number".

    The following processes should not be considered for purposes of origin:

    (i) dissolving in water or other solvents;

    (ii) the elimination of solvents including solvent water; or

    (iii) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.

    A chemical reaction as defined above is to be considered as origin conferring.

    (b) Mixtures and Blends: The deliberate and proportionally controlled mixing or blending (including dispersing) of materials, other than the addition of diluents, to conform to predetermined specifications which results in the production of a good having physical or chemical characteristics which are relevant to the purposes or uses of the good and are different from the input materials is to be considered to be as origin conferring.

    (c) Purification: Purification is to be considered as origin conferring provided that purification occurs in the territory of one or both of the Parties results in one of the following criteria being satisfied:

    (i) purification of a good resulting in the elimination of at least 80 per cent of the content of existing impurities; or

    (ii) the reduction or elimination of impurities resulting in a good suitable for one or more of the following applications:

    (aa) pharmaceutical, medicinal, cosmetic, veterinary, or food grade substances;

    (bb) chemical products and reagents for analytical, diagnostic or laboratory uses;

    (cc) elements and components for use in micro-electronics;

    (dd) specialised optical uses;

    (ee) biotechnical use (e.g., in cell culturing, in genetic technology, or as a catalyst);

    (ff) carriers used in a separation process; or

    (gg) nuclear grade uses.

    (d) Change in particle size: The deliberate and controlled modification in particle size of a good, other than by merely crushing or pressing, resulting in a good having a defined particle size, defined particle size distribution or defined surface area, which is relevant to the purposes of the resulting good and having different physical or chemical characteristics from the input materials, is to be considered as origin conferring.

    (e) Standard materials: Standard materials (including standard solutions) are preparations suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing uses having precise degrees of purity or proportions which are certified by the manufacturer. The production of standard materials is to be considered as origin conferring.

    (f) Isomer separation: The isolation or separation of isomers from a mixture of isomers is to be considered as origin conferring.
