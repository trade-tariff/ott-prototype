1. This Annex sets out the conditions required for a product to be considered originating within the meaning of Article 5 (Sufficient Production).

2. The following definitions apply:

    - **chapter** means a chapter of the Harmonized System;

    - **heading** means any four-digit number, or the first four digits of any number, used in the Harmonized System;

    - **section** means a section of the Harmonized System;

    - **subheading** means any six-digit number, or the first six digits of any number, used in the Harmonized System; and

    - **tariff provision** means a chapter, heading, or subheading of the Harmonized System.

3. The product-specific rule of origin, or set of rules of origin, that applies to a product classified in a particular heading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings is set out immediately adjacent to that heading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings.

4. Unless otherwise specified, a requirement of a change in tariff classification or any other condition set out in a product-specific rule of origin applies only to non-originating material.

5. Section, chapter, heading, or subheading notes, where applicable, are found at the beginning of each new section, chapter, heading, or subheading. These notes must be read in conjunction with the product-specific rules of origin for the applicable section, chapter, heading, or subheading and may impose further conditions on, or provide an alternative to, the product-specific rules of origin.

6. Unless otherwise specified, reference to weight in a product-specific rule of origin means the net weight, which is the weight of a material or a product not including the weight of packaging as set out in the definitions of ‘net weight of non-originating material’ and ‘net weight of the product’ in Article 1 (Definitions) of this Protocol.

7. A reference to non-originating sugar in a product-specific rule of origin means the non-originating material referred to in Article 16 (Sugar) of this Protocol.

8. If a product-specific rule of origin requires:

    1. a change from any other chapter, heading, or subheading, or a change to product x (¹) from any other chapter, heading, or subheading, only non-originating material classified in a chapter, heading, or subheading other than that of the product may be used in the production of the product;

    2. a change from within a heading or subheading, or from within any one of these headings or subheadings, non-originating material classified within the heading or subheading may be used in the production of the product, as well as non-originating material classified in a chapter, heading, or subheading other than that of the product;

    3. a change from any heading or subheading outside a group, only non-originating material classified outside the group of headings or subheadings may be used in the production of the product;

    4. that a product is wholly obtained, the product must be wholly obtained within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). If a shipment consists of a number of identical products classified under tariff provision x, each product shall be considered separately;

    5. production in which all the material of tariff provision x used is wholly obtained, all of the material of tariff provision x used in production of the product must be wholly obtained within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products);

    6. a change from tariff provision x, whether or not there is also a change from any other chapter, heading or subheading, the value of any non-originating material that satisfies the change in tariff classification specified in the phrase commencing with the words ‘whether or not’ is not considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. If two or more product-specific rules of origin are applicable to a heading, subheading, or group of headings or subheadings, the change in tariff classification specified in this phrase reflects the change specified in the first rule of origin;

    7. that the value of non-originating materials of tariff provision x does not exceed x per cent of the transaction value or ex-works price of the product, only the value of the non-originating material specified in this rule of origin is considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance);

    8. that the value of non-originating materials classified in the same tariff provision as the final product does not exceed x per cent of the transaction value or ex-works price of the product, non-originating material classified in a tariff provision other than that of the product may be used in the production of the product. Only the value of the non-originating materials classified in the same tariff provision as the final product is considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance);

    9. that the value of all non-originating materials does not exceed x per cent of the transaction value or ex-works price of the product, the value of all non-originating materials is considered when calculating the value of non-originating materials. The percentage for the maximum value of non-originating materials as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance); and

    10. that the net weight of non-originating material of tariff provision x used in production does not exceed x per cent of the net weight of the product, the specified non-originating materials may be used in the production of the product, provided that it does not exceed the specified percentage of the net weight of the product in accordance with the definition of ‘net weight of the product’ in Article 1. The percentage for the maximum weight of non-originating material as set out in this rule of origin may not be exceeded through the use of Article 6 (Tolerance).

9. The product-specific rule of origin represents the minimum amount of production required on non-originating material for the resulting product to achieve originating status. A greater amount of production than that required by the product-specific rule of origin for that product also confers originating status.

10. If a product-specific rule of origin provides that a specified non-originating material may not be used, or that the value or weight of a specified non-originating material cannot exceed a specific threshold, these conditions do not apply to non-originating material classified elsewhere in the Harmonized System.

11. In accordance with Article 5 (Sufficient Production), when a material obtains originating status in the territory of a Party and this material is further used in the production of a product for which origin is being determined, no account will be taken of any non-originating material used in the production of that material. This applies whether or not the material has acquired originating status inside the same factory where the product is produced.

12. The product-specific rules of origin set out in this Annex also apply to used products.

(¹)  In these notes product x or tariff provision x denotes a specific product or tariff provision, and x per cent denotes a specific percentage.
