### Sufficiently worked or processed products

1. For the purposes of Part A of this Origin Reference Document, products which are not wholly obtained shall be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed in Cameroon when the conditions set out in the list in Appendix 2 or in Appendix 2A are fulfilled. Those conditions indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Cameroon Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in Appendices 2 and 2A, should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

(a) their total value does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the product;

(b) none of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 1996.

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply except as provided for in Article 5.
