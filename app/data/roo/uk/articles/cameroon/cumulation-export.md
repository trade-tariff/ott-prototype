### Cumulation of origin

1. Materials originating in the United Kingdom, the EU, the OCT or eligible ACP States shall be considered as materials originating in Cameroon when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided they have undergone working or processing beyond that referred to in Article 5.

2. Working and processing carried out in the United Kingdom, the EU, the OCT or eligible ACP States shall be considered as having been carried out in Cameroon when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in Cameroon beyond that referred to in Article 5.

3. In determining whether, for the purposes of paragraph 1, the products/materials originate:

   1. in eligible ACP States, the provisions of Part A of this Origin Reference Document shall apply mutatis mutandis;

   2. in the United Kingdom, the OCT or the EU the provisions of Part B of this Origin Reference Document shall apply mutatis mutandis.

4. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 10, materials originating in South Africa shall be considered as originating in Cameroon when incorporated into a product obtained there provided they have undergone working or processing beyond that referred to in Article 5. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

5. Products which have acquired originating status by virtue of paragraph 4 shall continue to be considered as products originating in Cameroon only when the value added there exceeds the value of the materials used that originate in South Africa. If that is not so, the products concerned shall be considered as originating in South Africa. In the allocation of origin, no account shall be taken of materials originating in South Africa which have undergone sufficient working or processing in Cameroon.

6. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 4 shall not apply to the products listed in Appendices 7 and 10.

7. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 4 shall apply to the products listed in Appendix 8 only when the United Kingdom tariffs on those products have been eliminated on imports from South Africa. The United Kingdom shall publish the date on which the conditions of this paragraph have been fulfilled on the gov.uk website.

8. Without prejudice to paragraphs 6 and 7, working and processing carried out in South Africa shall be considered as having been carried out in another Member State of the South African Customs Union (SACU), being an eligible ACP State, when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in that other Member State of the SACU.

9. Without prejudice to paragraphs 6 and 7 and at the request of Cameroon, working and processing carried out in South Africa shall be considered as having been carried out in Cameroon or in an eligible ACP State when the materials undergo subsequent working or processing in Cameroon or in an eligible ACP State within the context of a regional economic integration agreement.

10. The request shall be submitted by Cameroon to the United Kingdom, which shall take a decision on the request in accordance with its internal procedures.

11. The cumulation provided for in paragraph 4 may be applied only where the South African materials used have acquired the status of originating products through the application of rules of origin identical to those set out in Part A of this Origin Reference Document. The cumulation provided for in paragraphs 8 and 9 may be applied only through the application of rules of origin identical to those set out in Part A of this Origin Reference Document.

12. At the request of Cameroon, materials originating in a neighbouring developing country, other than an eligible ACP State, belonging to a coherent geographical entity, shall be considered as materials originating in Cameroon when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided that:

    1.  the working or processing carried out in Cameroon exceeds the operations listed in Article 5, and

    2.  Cameroon, the United Kingdom and the other countries concerned have concluded an agreement on adequate administrative procedures which will ensure correct implementation of this paragraph.

    This paragraph shall not apply to tuna products classified under Chapter 3 or 16 and to rice products under tariff heading 1006.
For the purpose of determining whether products originate in a neighbouring developing country, the provisions of Part A of this Origin Reference Document shall apply.
Requests shall be submitted by Cameroon to the United Kingdom, which shall take a decision on the request in accordance with its internal procedures. Such decisions shall also identify the products for which cumulation provided for under this paragraph may not be permitted.
