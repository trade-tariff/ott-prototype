The terms ‘their vessels’ and ‘their factory ships’ in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:

1. which are registered in the United Kingdom or in a CARIFORUM State;

2. which sail under the flag of the United Kingdom or of a CARIFORUM State; and

3. which meet one of the following conditions:

    1. they are at least 50 % owned by nationals of the United Kingdom, an EU Member State or of a CARIFORUM State; or

    2. they are owned by companies:

        - which have their head office and their main place of business in the United Kingdom, an EU Member State or in a CARIFORUM State; and

        - which are at least 50 % owned by the United Kingdom, an EU Member State or by a CARIFORUM State, public entities or nationals of that State.

Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the United Kingdom shall recognise, upon request of a CARIFORUM State, that vessels chartered or leased by operators of such CARIFORUM State be treated as ‘their vessels’ in order to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone, provided that the charter or lease agreement, for which operators of the United Kingdom have been offered the right of first refusal, has been accepted by the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Trade Facilitation as providing adequate opportunities for developing the fishing capacity of the requesting CARIFORUM State and in particular as conferring on such CARIFORUM State the nautical and commercial responsibility for the chartered or leased vessels.
