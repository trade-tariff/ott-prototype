 
1.	The preferential treatment provided for under the United Kingdom-Chile Agreement applies only to products satisfying the requirements of this Origin Reference Document, which are transported directly between the United Kingdom and Chile or through the territory of the European Union. However, products may be transported through other territories with transhipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit or warehousing and do not undergo operations other than adding or affixing marks, labels, or seals; unloading; reloading; splitting of consignments; or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition. 
 
2.	Compliance with paragraph 1 shall be considered as satisfied unless the customs authorities have reason to believe the contrary. In such cases, the customs authorities may require the importer to provide evidence of compliance, which shall be given by any appropriate means, such as contractual transport documents, for example bills of lading, or factual or concrete evidence based on marking or numbering of packages, or any evidence related to the goods themselves. 
 
3.	This Article is without prejudice to Article 31.
