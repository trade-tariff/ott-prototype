1. Products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in the **product-specific rules** below are fulfilled.

    The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Chile Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials.

    Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the product-specific rules is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the resulting product do not apply to the incorporated product, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the products which are not wholly obtained and listed in the product-specific rules are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in the product-specific rules are fulfilled. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply for three years following the entry into force of the United Kingdom-Chile Agreement.

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the product-specific rules, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:
   1. their total value does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the product;
   2. any of the percentages given in the product-specific rules for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

    This paragraph **shall not apply to products falling within chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2002**.

4. Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall apply except as provided in Article 6.
