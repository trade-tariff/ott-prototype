1. The following shall be considered as wholly obtained in a Pacific State or in the UK:

   1. mineral products extracted from their soil or from their seabed;

   2. fruit and vegetable products harvested there;

   3. live animals born and raised there;

   4. products from live animals raised there;

   5. 
      1. products obtained by hunting or fishing conducted there;

      2. products of aquaculture, including mariculture, where the fish are born and raised there;

   6. products of sea fishing and other products taken from the sea outside the territorial waters of the UK or of a Pacific State by their vessels;

   7. products made aboard their factory ships exclusively from products referred to in subparagraph (f);

   8. used articles collected there fit only for the recovery of raw materials, including used tyres fit only for retreading or for use as waste;

   9. waste and scrap resulting from manufacturing operations conducted there;

   10. products extracted from marine soil or subsoil outside their territorial waters provided that they have sole rights to work that soil or subsoil;

   11. goods produced there exclusively from the products specified in subparagraphs (a) to (j).

2. The terms ‘their vessels’ and ‘their factory ships’ in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:

   1. which are registered in the UK or in a Pacific State;

   2. which sail under the flag of the UK or of a Pacific State;

   3. which meet one of the following conditions:

      - they are at least 50 per cent owned by nationals of the UK, a Member State of the EU or of a Pacific State; or

      - they are owned by companies:

        - which have their head office and their main place of business in the UK, a Member State of the EU or in a Pacific State; and

        - which are at least 50 per cent owned by the UK, by a Member State of the EU or by a Pacific State, public entities or nationals of that State.

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the UK shall recognise, upon request of a Pacific State, that vessels chartered or leased by the Pacific State shall be treated as ‘their vessels’ to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone provided that the charter or lease agreement, for which the UK has been offered the right of first refusal, has been accepted by the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin as providing adequate opportunities for developing the capacity of the Pacific State to fish on its own account and in particular as conferring on the Pacific State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel at its disposal for a significant period of time.

4. The conditions of paragraph 2 can be fulfilled in different States insofar as they belong to Pacific States. In this case, products shall be deemed to have the origin of the State by whose nationals or by a company by which the vessel or factory ship is owned in accordance with paragraph 2(c). In the event of a vessel or factory ship owned by nationals or companies of States belonging to different Economic Partnership Agreements, the products shall be deemed to have the origin of the State whose nationals or companies contribute to the highest share in accordance to the provisions of paragraph 2(c).
