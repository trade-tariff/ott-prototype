### Cumulation in the Pacific States

1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2), products shall be considered as originating in a Pacific State if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the UK, in the EU, in the other ACP States, in the OCT or in the other Pacific States, provided the working or processing carried out in that Pacific State goes beyond that of the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

2. Where the working or processing carried out in the Pacific State does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in that Pacific State only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country or territory which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in that Pacific State.

3. Products originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, which do not undergo any working or processing in the Pacific State, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.

4. For the purpose of implementing Article 2(2)(b), working or processing carried out in the UK, in the EU, in the other Pacific States, in the other ACP States or in the OCT shall be considered as having been carried out in a Pacific State when the products obtained undergo subsequent working or processing in this Pacific State. Where pursuant to this provision the originating products are obtained in two or more of the countries or territories concerned, they shall be considered as originating in this Pacific State only if the working or processing goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.

5. Where the working or processing carried out in the Pacific State does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in that Pacific State only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 4. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country or territory which accounts for the highest value of materials used in the manufacture.

6. The cumulation provided in this Article may only be applied provided that:

   1. the countries involved in the acquisition of the originating status and the country of destination have concluded an agreement on administrative cooperation which ensures a correct implementation of this Article;

   2. materials and products have acquired originating status by the application of the rules of origin identical to those given in this Origin Reference Document;

   3. the Pacific States will provide the UK with details of agreements on administrative cooperation with the other countries or territories referred to in this Article. The UK and the Pacific States shall publish, according to their own procedures, the date on which the cumulation provided for in this Article may be applied with those countries or territories listed in this Article which have fulfilled the necessary requirements.

7. The cumulation provided for in this Article may only be applied for the products listed in Annex IX and for rice of tariff heading 1006 respectively, when the materials used in the manufacture of such products are originating, or the working or processing is carried out in a Pacific State or in an other ACP State member of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA).

8. This Article shall not apply to products of Annex XI originating in South Africa. The cumulation provided for in this Article shall apply to the products originating in South Africa listed in Annex XII .

### Cumulation with neighbouring developing countries

1. At the request of the Pacific States and following the provisions of Article 36(2), materials originating in a neighbouring developing country, other than an ACP State, belonging to a coherent geographical entity, a listing of which is at Annex VIII (a), can be considered as materials originating in a Pacific State when incorporated into a product obtained there. It shall not be necessary that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing, provided that:

   1. the working or processing carried out in the Pacific State exceeds the operations listed in Article 7;

   2. the Pacific States, the UK and the neighbouring developing countries concerned have concluded an agreement on adequate administrative cooperation procedures which will ensure correct implementation of this paragraph.

2. The cumulation provided for in this Article shall not be applicable to the products to be listed upon a decision of the Special Committee on Customs Cooperation and Rules of Origin.

3. For the purpose of determining whether the products originate in the neighbouring developing country as defined in Annex VIII (a), the provisions of this Origin Reference Document shall apply.
