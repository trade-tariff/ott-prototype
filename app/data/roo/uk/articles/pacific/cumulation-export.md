### Cumulation in the UK

1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in the UK if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in a Pacific State, in  the  EU,  in the other ACP States or in the OCTs, provided the working or processing carried out in the UK goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

2. Where the working or processing carried out in the UK does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the  UK only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 1. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country or territory which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the UK.

3. Products originating in one of the countries or territories referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, which do not undergo any working or processing in the UK, retain their origin if exported into one of these countries or territories.

4. For the purpose of implementing Article 2(1)(b), working or processing carried out in a Pacific State, in the EU, in the other ACP States or in the OCT shall be considered as having been carried out in the UK when the products obtained undergo subsequent working or processing in the UK. Where pursuant to this provision the originating products are obtained in two or more of the countries or territories concerned, they shall be considered as originating in the UK only if the working or processing goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.

5. Where the working or processing carried out in the UK does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the UK only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used in any one of the other countries or territories referred to in paragraph 4. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country or territory which accounts for the highest value of materials used in the manufacture.
