These notes are derived from Introductory note 5 to the list of product-specific rules.

### Note 5:

1. Where, for a given product in the list, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in column 3 shall not be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of this product and which, taken together, represent **10 % or less** of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used. (See also Notes 5.3 and 5.4).

2. However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 5.1 may be applied only to **mixed products which have been made from two or more basic textile materials**.

   The following are the basic textile materials:

   - silk,
   - wool,
   - coarse animal hair,
   - fine animal hair,
   - horsehair,
   - cotton,
   - paper-making materials and paper,
   - flax,
   - true hemp,
   - jute and other textile bast fibres,
   - sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave,
   - coconut, abaca, ramie and other vegetable textile fibres,
   - synthetic man-made filaments,
   - artificial man-made filaments,
   - current-conducting filaments,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene,
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide),
   - synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride),
   - other synthetic man-made staple fibres,
   - artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose,
   - other artificial man-made staple fibres,
   - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped,
   - yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped,
   - products of heading 5605 (metallised yarn) incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film,
   - other products of heading 5605.
   
   
   _Example:_
   
   A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp) may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the yarn.
   
   _Example:_
   
   A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from chemical materials or textile pulp), or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the origin-rules (which require manufacture from natural fibres, not carded or combed or otherwise prepared for spinning), or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10 % of the weight of the fabric.
   
   _Example:_
   
   Tufted textile fabric, of heading 5802, made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and cotton fabric of heading 5210, is a only mixed product if the cotton fabric is itself a mixed fabric made from yarns classified in two separate headings, or if the cotton yarns used are themselves mixtures.
   
   _Example:_
   
   If the tufted textile fabric concerned had been made from cotton yarn of heading 5205 and synthetic fabric of heading 5407, then, obviously, the yarns used are two separate basic textile materials and the tufted textile fabric is, accordingly, a mixed product.

3. In the case of products incorporating ‘yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped’, this tolerance is **20 %** in respect of this yarn.

4. In the case of products incorporating ‘strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film’, this tolerance is **30 %** in respect of this strip.
