## Article 18 - Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment

1. An importer may make a claim for preferential tariff treatment, based on:

   - (a) a declaration of origin completed by the exporter, producer, or, in the case of an exporter or producer in Australia, an authorised representative of the exporter or producer; or

   - (b) the importer’s knowledge that a good is originating.

2. A declaration of origin:

   - (a) need not follow a prescribed format;

   - (b) must be in writing, including electronic format;

   - (c) must specify that the good is both originating and meets the requirements of this Origin Reference Document;

   - (d) must be attached to, or provided on, an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified; and

   - (e) must fulfil the data requirements as set out in Annex I (Data Requirements).

3. A declaration of origin may apply to:

   - (a) a single shipment of a good into the territory of a Party; or

   - (b) multiple shipments of identical goods within any period specified in the declaration of origin, but not exceeding 12 months.

4. A declaration of origin is valid for one year after the date that it was completed or for such longer period specified by the laws and regulations of the importing Party.

5. If unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of rule 2(a) of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonized System 2017 are imported by more than one shipment, a single declaration of origin for such products may be used on request of the importer and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party.

## Article 19 - Basis of a Declaration of Origin or Importer’s Knowledge

1. If a producer declares the origin of a good, the declaration of origin must be completed on the basis of the producer having information that the good is originating.

2. If the exporter is not the producer of the good, a declaration of origin may be completed by the exporter of the good on the basis of:

   - (a) the exporter having information that the good is originating; or

   - (b) the exporter placing reasonable reliance on the producer’s information that the good is originating.

3. If an importer of the good makes a claim for preferential tariff treatment on the basis of the importer’s knowledge the good is originating, the claim is made on the basis of:

   - (a) the importer having documentation that the good is originating; or

   - (b) the importer placing reasonable reliance on supporting documentation provided by the exporter or producer that the good is originating.

4. For greater certainty, nothing in paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 shall be construed to allow a Party to require an exporter or producer to complete a declaration of origin or provide a declaration of origin to another person.

## Article 20 - Discrepancies

A declaration of origin shall not be rejected due to minor errors or discrepancies, such as slight discrepancies between documents, omissions of information or typing errors, provided these minor discrepancies or errors do not create doubt as to the originating status of the good.

## Article 21 - Waiver of Declaration of Origin

An importer, exporter or producer shall not be required to provide a declaration of origin if:

   - (a) the customs value of the importation does not exceed, in the case of Australia, 1,000 Australian Dollars or, in the case of the United Kingdom, 1,000 Pound Sterling, or any higher amount as the importing Party may establish; or

   - (b) it is a good for which the importing Party has waived the requirement or does not require the importer to present a declaration of origin, provided that the importation does not form part of a series of importations, which the customs authority of the importing Party reasonably considers to have been carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the importing Party’s laws and regulations governing claims for preferential tariff treatment under the United Kingdom-Australia Agreement.

## Article 22 - Obligations Relating to Importation

1. Except as otherwise provided for in this Origin Reference Document, for the purpose of claiming preferential tariff treatment, the importer shall:

   - (a) declare that the good qualifies as an originating good;

   - (b) possess either:

     - (i) a valid declaration of origin; or

     - (ii) documentation that formed the basis for the importer’s knowledge that the good is originating;

   - (c) provide to the importing Party a copy of any declaration of origin and other evidence that the good qualifies as an originating good, if required by the importing Party; and

   - (d) if required by an importing Party to demonstrate that the requirements in Article 17 (Non-Alteration) have been satisfied, provide relevant documents, such as transport documents, and in the case of storage, storage documents.

2. If the importer has reason to believe that the claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on incorrect information that could affect the accuracy or validity of the declaration of origin, the importer shall correct the importation document and pay any customs duty and, if applicable, penalties owed.

3. If the exporter or producer has reason to believe that the declaration of origin is based on incorrect information that could affect the accuracy or validity of the declaration of origin, they shall be obliged to immediately notify the importer in writing of any change affecting the originating status of each good to which the declaration of origin applies.

4. When considering imposing a penalty in relation to a claim for preferential tariff treatment a Party may consider as a significant mitigating factor a voluntary notification given prior to the discovery of that error by the Party and in accordance with paragraph 2 or paragraph 3, provided that in the case of a notification given by an importer, the importer corrects the error and repays any duties owing.

## Article 23 - Record Keeping Requirements

1. An importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the territory of a Party shall maintain, for a period of four years from the date of importation of the good, or such longer period as the importing Party specifies:

   - (a) documentation related to the good’s importation, including any declaration of origin that served as the basis for the claim; and

   - (b) all records necessary to demonstrate that the good is originating and qualified for preferential tariff treatment, if the claim was based on the importer’s knowledge that the good was originating.

2. A producer or exporter that provides a declaration of origin shall maintain, for a period of four years from the date the declaration of origin was issued, or such longer period as the importing Party specifies, all records necessary to demonstrate that a good for which the exporter or producer provided a declaration of origin is originating.

3. An importer, exporter, or producer may choose to maintain the records specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 in any medium that allows for prompt retrieval, including electronic, optical, magnetic, or written form in accordance with a Party’s laws and regulations.

## Article 24 - Determinations on Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment

1. An importer may be denied a claim for preferential tariff treatment if:

   - (a) the importing Party determines that the good does not satisfy any of the requirements of this Origin Reference Document;

   - (b) pursuant to a verification under Article 4.24 (Verification of Origin) of the United Kingdom-Australia Agreement, the importing Party has not received sufficient information to determine that the good qualifies as originating, or that the importer, exporter, producer, or supplier has failed to comply with any requirements of this Origin Reference Document;

   - (c) the exporter, producer, or importer fails to respond to a written request for information in accordance with Article 4.24 (Verification of Origin) of the United Kingdom-Australia Agreement; or

   - (d) the importer, exporter, or producer fails to comply with any of the relevant requirements for obtaining preferential tariff treatment.

2. If an importer is denied a claim for preferential tariff treatment, they shall be issued with a determination that includes the reasons for the determination by the customs authority.

3. A claim for preferential tariff treatment shall not be rejected for the sole reason that the invoice or other commercial document was issued in a non-party. If an invoice is issued in a non-party, the declaration of origin shall be separate from the invoice.

## Article 25 - Refunds and Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatments after Importation

1. An importer may apply for preferential tariff treatment and a refund of any excess duties paid for a good if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, provided that the good would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment when it was imported into the territory of the Party.

2. As a condition for preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1, an importer shall be required to:

   - (a) make a claim for preferential tariff treatment;

   - (b) where applicable, provide a copy of any declaration of origin; and

   - (c) provide such other documentation relating to the importation of the good as the importing Party may require, no later than two years after the date of importation.
