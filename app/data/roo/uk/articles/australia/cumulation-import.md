### Cumulation of origin

1.	A good shall be regarded as originating if the good is produced in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers, provided that the good satisfies the requirements of Article 2 (Origin Criteria) and all other applicable requirements in this Origin Reference Document. 

2.	An originating good or material of one Party shall be considered originating in the territory of the other Party when used in the production of a good in the territory of the other Party.

3.	Production undertaken on a non-originating material in the territory of one or both Parties by one or more producers may contribute toward the originating content of a good for the purpose of determining its origin, regardless of whether that production was sufficient to confer originating status to the material itself.
