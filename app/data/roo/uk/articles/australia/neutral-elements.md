In the Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Australia, neutral elements are referred to as **indirect material**.

An indirect material shall be considered to be originating without regard to where it is produced.

“Indirect material” means a material used in the production, testing, or inspection of a good but not physically incorporated into the good; or a material used in the maintenance of buildings or the operation of equipment, associated with the production of a good, including:

- fuel, energy, catalysts, and solvents;

- equipment, devices, and supplies used to test or inspect the good;

- gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment, and supplies;

- tools, dies, and moulds;

- spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings;

- lubricants, greases, compounding materials and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; and

- any other material that is not incorporated into the good but the use of which in the production of the good can reasonably be demonstrated to be a part of that production;
