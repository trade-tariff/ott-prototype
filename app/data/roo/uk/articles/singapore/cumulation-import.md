6. Materials originating in an ASEAN country, which is applying with the UK a preferential agreement in accordance with Article XXIV of the GATT 1994, shall be considered as materials originating in a Party when incorporated in a product obtained in that Party, provided that they have undergone working or processing in that Party which goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing).
