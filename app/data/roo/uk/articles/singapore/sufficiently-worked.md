### Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products

1. For the purposes of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (General Requirements), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Origin Reference Document are fulfilled.

2. The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Singapore Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing, and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Origin Reference Document is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to the product that acquired originating status, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex B or B(a) to this Origin Reference Document, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:

    (a) ten percent of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of HS 2017, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;

    (b) ten percent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2017, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex A to this Origin Reference Document, shall apply.

4. Paragraph 3 shall not be construed to allow any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the list in Annex B to this Origin Reference Document to be exceeded. 

5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). However, without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification), the tolerance provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule for that product laid down in the list in Annex B to this Origin Reference Document requires that such materials be wholly obtained.
