2. For the purposes of Article 2 of this Origin Reference Document, and notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the products listed in Annex IIA to this Origin Reference Document may be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in that Annex are fulfilled. Annex IIA to this Origin Reference Document shall apply only to exports from Côte d'Ivoire, for a period of five (5) years from the date of entry into force of Protocol 1 concerning the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation of the EU-Côte d’Ivoire Stepping Stone EPA.
