### Sufficiently worked or processed products

1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Appendix 2 are fulfilled.

The conditions referred to above indicate, for all products covered by the Agreement, the working or processing which shall be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list, shall not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

a) their total value does not exceed 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the product;

b) any of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2007 for which Appendix 1 shall apply. Additionally, this paragraph shall not apply to products wholly obtained in the Parties. However, without prejudice to Article 7, the tolerance provided for in this paragraph applies also to the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Appendix 2 for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 6.
