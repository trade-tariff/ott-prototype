1. The preferential treatment provided for under the Agreement applies only to products satisfying the requirements of this Origin Reference Document, which are transported directly between the UK and the signatory Andean Countries or, as part of that transport, through the territory of the European Union in transit or transshipment, with or without temporary warehousing. However, products may be transported through other territories with, should the occasion arise, transshipment or temporary warehousing in such territories, provided that they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the country of transit, transshipment or temporary warehousing and do not undergo operations other than unloading, reloading or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition. 

2. For the avoidance of doubt, consignments that are in transit, transshipment or temporary warehousing in the territory of the European Union may undergo operations including unloading, reloading, splitting, storing, labelling, marking or any operation designed to preserve them in good condition provided they remain under the surveillance of the customs authorities in the European Union Member State of transit, transshipment or warehousing.

3. Originating products may be transported by pipeline across territory other than that of the UK or the signatory Andean Countries.

4. Evidence that the conditions set out in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 have been fulfilled shall be supplied, upon request, to the customs authorities of the importing Party by the submission of:

   1. transportation documents, such as airway bills, bills of lading, cargo manifest, or multimodal, or combined transportation documents, that certify transport from the country of origin to the importing Party;
   
   2. customs documents that authorise the trans-shipment or temporary storage; or 

   3. failing these, any substantiating documents.
