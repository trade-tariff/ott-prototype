In the Free Trade Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and New Zealand, neutral elements are referred to as **indirect material**.

1. An indirect material is considered to be originating without regard to where it is produced.

2. Indirect material means a material used in the production, testing, or inspection of a good but not physically incorporated into the good; or a material used in the maintenance of buildings or the operation of equipment, associated with the production of a good, including:

(a) fuel, energy, catalysts, and solvents;

(b) equipment, devices, and supplies used to test or inspect the good; 

(c) gloves, glasses, footwear, clothing, safety equipment, and supplies; 

(d) tools, dies, and moulds; 

(e) spare parts and materials used in the maintenance of equipment and buildings; 

(f) lubricants, greases, compounding materials, and other materials used in production or used to operate equipment and buildings; and

(g) any other material that is not incorporated into the good but the use of which in the production of the good can reasonably be demonstrated to be part of that production.
