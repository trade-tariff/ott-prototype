## Article 17 - Claims for Preferential Treatment

1. An importer may make a claim for preferential tariff treatment, based on a written or electronic origin declaration completed by the producer or exporter of the good, which meets the requirements of Article 18 (Origin Declaration).

2. In addition to the method provided for in paragraph 1, an importer may make a claim for preferential tariff treatment based on the importer's knowledge that a product is originating. Such claims shall be made by the importer of the good on the basis of:

    (a) the importer having documentation demonstrating that the good is originating; or

    (b) reasonable reliance on supporting documentation provided by the exporter or producer that the good is originating.

3. A claim for preferential tariff treatment may be denied if the importer, exporter, or producer of the good being imported fails to comply with any requirement of this Origin Reference Document. A claim for preference may be denied if the good does not qualify as an originating good. 

4. If a claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on an origin declaration, an importer must provide, on the request of the importing Party’s customs authority, a copy of the origin declaration and, in any event, such other documentation relating to the importation of the good in accordance with the domestic laws and regulations of the importing Party.

## Article 18 - Origin Declaration

1. An origin declaration does not need to follow a prescribed format, provided it contains all minimum data elements identified in Annex I (Origin Declarations – Guidance).

2. An origin declaration may be provided on, or attached to, an invoice or other commercial document issued in the exporting Party that contains some of the required minimum data elements, provided all the minimum data elements are included on or with the origin declaration.

3. An origin declaration shall be valid for at least 12 months from the date it was completed or for a longer period as provided by the importing Party.  

4. An origin declaration will be applicable to a single importation of one or more goods or multiple importations of identical goods that occur within a specified period not exceeding 12 months after the date of original declaration.

5. For any originating good imported into the territory of a Party on or after the date of entry into force of the United Kingdom-New Zealand Agreement, the customs authority of the importing Party shall accept an origin declaration that has been completed and signed prior to the date of entry into force by the exporter or producer of that good.

6. If unassembled or disassembled products within the meaning of General Rule 2(a) of the Harmonized System falling within Sections XV to XXI of the Harmonized System 2017 are imported in instalments, a single origin declaration for those products may be used on request of the importer and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the customs authority of the importing Party.

## Article 19 - Waiver of Origin Documentation

1. An importer, exporter or producer shall not be required to present an origin declaration as specified in Article 18 (Origin Declaration) in respect of:
 
    (a) an importation of a good whose customs value does not exceed 2,000 New Zealand dollars for goods imported in New Zealand, or 1,000 United Kingdom pounds for goods imported into the United Kingdom, or such higher amount as the importing Party may establish; or

    (b) an importation of a good into the territory of the importing Party for which the importing Party has waived the requirement for an origin declaration. 

2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to an importation when the customs authority of the importing Party reasonably considers that the importation is part of a series of importations that have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this Origin Reference Document related to origin declarations.

## Article 20 - Delayed Claims for Preferential Treatment

1. An importer may apply for preferential tariff treatment, and a refund of any excess duties paid for a good, if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, provided that the good would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment when it was imported into the territory of the Party.

2. As a condition for preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1, an importer shall be required to:

    (a) make a claim for preferential tariff treatment;

    (b) provide a statement that the good was originating at the time of importation;
    
    (c) provide a copy of an origin declaration, if the claim is based on an origin declaration;  and

    (d) provide such other documentation relating to the importation of the good as the importing Party may require.

3. An application under this Article must be made within one year of the date of importation, or a longer period if specified in the importing Party’s law. 

## Article 21 - Incorrect Claims for Preferential Treatment

1. An exporter or producer that has completed an origin declaration, and becomes aware or has reason to believe that it contains incorrect information, shall be obliged to immediately notify the importer in writing of any change affecting the originating status of each good to which the origin declaration applies.

2. If a claim is based on an origin declaration, an importer that becomes aware or has reason to believe that an origin declaration for a good which it has imported, and to which preferential treatment has been granted, contains incorrect information shall immediately notify the customs authority of the importing Party in writing of any change affecting the originating status of that good and pay any duties owing.

3. If a claim is based on importer’s knowledge, an importer that becomes aware or has reason to believe that the importer’s knowledge and supporting documentation for a good which it has imported, and to which preferential treatment has been granted, contains incorrect information shall immediately notify the customs authority of the importing Party in writing of any change affecting the originating status of that good and pay any duties owing.

4. When considering imposing a penalty in relation to an incorrect claim for preferential tariff treatment, a Party may consider as a significant mitigating factor a voluntary notification given in accordance with paragraph 1, 2 or 3, provided in the case of a notification given by an importer, the importer corrects the error and repays any duties owing.

## Article 22 - Minor Errors and Discrepancies

1. An origin declaration shall not be rejected due to minor discrepancies or errors, such as slight discrepancies between documents, omissions of information, or typing errors, provided these minor discrepancies or errors do not create doubt as to the originating status of the good.

2. If the customs authority of the importing Party determines that an origin declaration in respect of a good imported into its territory is illegible or defective on its face, the importer shall be granted a period of no less than 30 days after the date the customs authority of the importing Party advises the importer that the declaration is illegible or defective to provide the customs authority of the importing Party with a copy of the corrected origin declaration.

## Article 23 - Record Keeping Requirements

1. An exporter or producer that has completed an origin declaration is required to keep, and to provide, upon request, a copy of the origin declaration and all supporting documentation including any written statements from a producer or supplier which are necessary to evidence that the good is originating for four years after the completion of the origin declaration, or for such longer period of time as the exporting Party may specify.

2. An importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the territory of a Party shall maintain, for four years after the completion of the origin declaration, or for such longer period of time as that Party may specify:
 
    (a) the documentation related to the importation, including the origin declaration if that served as the basis for the claim; and 

    (b) if the claim was based on the importer's knowledge, all records necessary to demonstrate that the good satisfies the requirements to obtain originating status. 

3. In accordance with a Party’s law and regulations, an importer, exporter, or producer may maintain documentation or records in any medium, provided that the documentation or records can be retrieved and printed. 

4. Preferential treatment to a good that is the subject of a verification of origin may be denied when the importer, exporter, or producer of the good that is required to maintain records or documentation under this Article: 

    (a) fails to maintain records or documentation in accordance with this Origin Reference Document; or 

    (b) denies access to those records or documentation.


## Article 24 - Documentation Issued in a Non-Party

A claim for preferential tariff treatment shall not be rejected for the sole reason that any supporting documents which are required pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 18 (Origin Declaration) were issued in a non-party.

## Article 25 - Transitional Provisions for Goods in Transit

Preferential tariff treatment shall be granted to an originating good, if on the date of entry into force of the United Kingdom-New Zealand Agreement, the good:

    (a) was being transported to that Party in accordance with Article 10 (Non-Alteration); or 

    (b) had not been imported into that Party, 

and if a valid claim under Article 17 (Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment) for preferential tariff treatment is made within 180 days of the date of entry into force of the United Kingdom-New Zealand Agreement for that Party.
