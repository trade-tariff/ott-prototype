### Treatment of Packaging Materials and Packing Materials

1. For the purpose of determining whether a good is originating, packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale shall, if classified with the good, be:

    (a) disregarded in determining whether a good is wholly obtained or produced, or satisfies a process or change in tariff classification requirement set out in Annex II (Product Specific Rules of Origin) for the good; and

    (b) taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good. 

2. Packing materials and containers for shipment shall be disregarded in determining whether a good is originating.

3. Packing materials and containers for shipment means the goods used to protect a good during its transportation and does not include the packaging materials and containers in which a good is packaged for retail sale. 

### Recovered Materials and Remanufactured Goods

For the purposes of this Origin Reference Document: 

    (a)  a recovered material which is recovered in the territory of one or more of the Parties shall be treated as originating when it is used in the production of, and incorporated into, a remanufactured good in a Party; 

    (b) a remanufactured good shall only be treated as originating if it meets the relevant rule of origin for an equivalent good when new; and 

    (c) a recovered material not incorporated into a remanufactured good in one of the Parties shall be treated as originating only if it meets the relevant rule of origin for an equivalent good when new. 

### Fungible Goods and Materials

1. Fungible goods or materials means goods and materials of the same kind and commercial quality, possessing the same technical and physical characteristics and are interchangeable for commercial purposes.

2. A fungible good or material is treated as originating based on the:

    (a) physical segregation of each fungible good or material; or

    (b) use of any inventory management method recognised in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles if the fungible good or material is commingled, provided that the inventory management method selected is used throughout the fiscal year. 

3. The inventory management system must ensure that no more goods receive originating status than would have been the case if the fungible goods or materials had been physically segregated.
