For the purposes of Article 2 (Origin Criteria) the following goods shall be considered as wholly obtained or produced entirely in one or both of the Parties if they are: 

(a)  minerals, mineral products, and other non-living natural resources, not included in subparagraphs (a) to (e), extracted or taken from there; 

(b)  plants, plant goods, or fungi grown, cultivated, harvested, picked, or gathered there; 

(c) live animals born and raised there; 

(d) goods obtained from live animals there; 

(e) an animal obtained by hunting, trapping, fishing, gathering, or capturing there, but not beyond the outer limits of the Parties’ territorial sea; 

(f) goods obtained from aquaculture there; 

(g) fish, shellfish, and other marine life taken from the sea, seabed, or subsoil, in accordance with international law, outside the territorial sea of the Parties and outside the territorial sea of non-parties by vessels that are registered, listed, or recorded with a Party and entitled to fly the flag of that Party, and any good produced from these goods on a factory ship that is registered, listed, or recorded with a Party and entitled to fly the flag of that Party;

(h) minerals, mineral products, and other non-living natural resources, taken or extracted from the seabed, subsoil, or ocean floor of the Parties’ exclusive economic zone or continental shelf, provided that that Party or person of the Party has rights to exploit that seabed, subsoil, or ocean floor; 

- (i) a good that is: 

- (i) waste or scrap derived from production there; *or*

- (ii) waste or scrap derived from used goods collected there, provided that those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials; *and*

- (j) a good produced there, exclusively from goods referred to in subparagraphs (a) to (i), or from their derivatives.

## Regional Value Content

Where Annex II (Product Specific Rules of Origin) specifies a regional value content test to determine whether a good is originating, the regional value content shall be calculated using one of the following methods:

![Determining Regional Value Content (RVC) using the Build-Down Method](/public/images/roo/rvc/rvc_build_down.png)

**Build-Up Method**: based on the value of originating materials

![Determining Regional Value Content (RVC) using the Build-Up Method](/public/images/roo/rvc/rvc_build_up.png)

in each case where:

- “**RVC**” is the regional value content of a good, expressed as a percentage; 

- “**VOM**” is the value of originating materials used in the production of the good in the territory of one or both of the Parties, as determined in accordance with Articles 5 (Materials Used in Production) to Article 7 (Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials); *and*

- “**VNM**” is the value of non-originating materials including materials of undetermined origin, used in the production of the good in the territory of one or both of the Parties, as determined in accordance with Articles 5 (Materials Used in Production) to Article 7 (Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials).

## Materials Used in Production

1. If a non-originating material undergoes further production such that it satisfies the requirements of this Origin Reference Document, the material is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was produced by the producer of the good. 

2.  If non-originating material is used in the production of a good, the following may be counted as originating content for the purposes of determining whether the resulting good meets a regional value content requirement:

    (a) the value of processing of the non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers; *and*

    (b) the value of any originating material used in the production of the non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or both of the Parties by one or more producers.

## Value of Materials Used in Production

For the purposes of this Origin Reference Document, the value of a material is:

(a) for a material imported by the producer of the good, the price actually paid or payable for the material at the time of import or other value determined in accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the good;

(b) for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced: 

- (i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where the producer is located; 

- (ii) the value as determined for an imported material in subparagraph (a); *or*

- (iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; *and*
    
(c) for a material that is self-produced: 

- (i) all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses; *and* 

- (ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued.

# Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials

1. For an originating material, the following expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 6 (Value of Materials Used in Production):

    (a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred to transport the material to the location of the producer of the good;

    (b) duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the territory of a Party, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; *and*
    
    (c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product. 

2. For a non-originating material or material of undetermined origin, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of the material:

    (a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer of the good; 

    (b) duties, taxes, and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or both Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable, or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; *and* 

    (c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product. 

3. For the purposes of this Article, if a cost, expense, or value is unknown or documentary evidence of the amount of the adjustment is not available, then no adjustment is allowed for that particular cost, expense, or value.
