### Sufficiently Worked or Processed Products

1. For the purpose of subparagraph (b) of Article 2 (General Requirements), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document are fulfilled.

2. The conditions referred to in paragraph 1 indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Viet Nam Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials.

    If a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in the list is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1 and subject to paragraphs 4 and 5, non-originating materials which, in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product, may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:

    (a) 10 per cent of the weight of the product or ex-works price for products of Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of HS 2012, other than processed fishery products referred to in Chapter 16 of HS 2012; or

    (b) 10 per cent of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products of Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2012, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex I to this Origin Reference Document apply.

4. Paragraph 3 shall not allow exceeding any of the percentages for the maximum value or weight of non-originating materials as specified in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document.

5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 do not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 4 (Wholly Obtained Products). Without prejudice to Article 6 (Insufficient Working or Processing) and paragraph 2 of Article 7 (Unit of Qualification), the tolerance provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4 applies to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product for which Annex II to this Origin Reference Document requires that such materials be wholly obtained.
