### Sufficiently worked or processed products
1. For the purposes of Article 2(b), products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II or Annex II(a) are fulfilled. Those conditions indicate, for all products covered by  the UK-Korea Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if:

    (a) non-originating materials undergo sufficient working or processing, which results in an originating product, and when that product is used in the subsequent manufacture of another product, no account shall be taken of the non-originating material contained therein; and 

    (b) non-originating and originating materials undergo processing, which results in a non-originating product, and when that product is used in a subsequent manufacture of another product, account shall be taken only of the non-originating materials contained therein.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, should not be used in the manufacture of a product may nevertheless be used, provided that:

    (a) their total value does not exceed 10 percent of the ex-works price of the product; and

    (b) any of the percentages given in the list in Annex II for the maximum value of non-originating materials are not exceeded through the application of this paragraph.

3. Paragraph 2 shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2007.

4. Paragraphs 1 through 3 shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 6.
