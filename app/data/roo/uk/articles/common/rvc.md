## Calculating Regional Value Content

Regional Value Content can be calculated using one of two methods:

- the Build-down method
- the Build-up method

Unless specified in the rule, exporters or producers can choose the RVC method to be used.

### Build-down Method

![RVC = (VOM / AV) x 100!](/public/images/roo/builddown.png)

where:

- VC is the **regional value content**, expressed as a percentage;
- AV is the **adjusted value** (the value for customs purposes), *and*
- VNM is the **value of non-originating materials** that are acquired and used by the producer in the production of the good. VNM does not include the value of a material that is self-produced



### Build-up Method
![RVC = (VOM / AV) x 100!](/public/images/roo/buildup.png)

where:
- RVC is the **regional value content**, expressed as a percentage;
- AV is the **adjusted value** (the value for customs purposes); *and*
- VOM is the **value of originating materials** that are acquired or self-produced, and used by the producer in the production of the good.
