Extended cumulation (also referred to as third-party or cross cumulation) allows for cumulation between countries which are not linked by a trade agreement or are linked by a trade agreement with different rules of origin to influence the origin of goods in the trade agreement between the two primary countries or blocs.

You are allowed to use inputs from a third-party country, which is not a member of the applicable FTA and consider them originating, provided that they meet the rules of origin under the relevant trade agreement.

Extended cumulation is the most flexible type of cumulation of originating inputs and is often limited to certain tariff headings, subheadings and codes or to certain types of products only. Please check the detailed agreement text.
