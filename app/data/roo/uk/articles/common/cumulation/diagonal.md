**Diagonal cumulation** operates between more than 2 countries.

Materials originating in a defined country or countries, may be used as materials originating in the country of export, when used in an export to a country not in the agreement. Diagonal cumulation comes with two crucial conditions attached:

1. all countries involved need to be joined by FTAs *and* 
2. rules of origin in these FTAs need to be identical.
