![Bilateral cumulation](/public/images/roo/cumulation/bilateral.png)

1. A company in country A would like to take advantage of the FTA with country B to receive 0% import duties
on the import of goods which require 100% of the value to be originating.
2. The goods are comprised of component parts that are sourced from both country A and country B.
3. As there is bilateral cumulation between the two countries and all component parts are sourced in either country A or country B, the goods can be considered as originating.
4. Even if all the parts came from country A and were just assembled in country B, the rules would be met.

    Goods may only be considered as originating if the parts from Country B have been processed to a degree beyond what is defined in the [insufficient processing clause](https://staging.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/rules_of_origin/4402200010/CY/sufficient_processing).
