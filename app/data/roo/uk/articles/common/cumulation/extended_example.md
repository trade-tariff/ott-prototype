![Extended cumulation](/public/images/cumulation/extended.png)

1. In order to take advantage of a 0% import duty, a business in Country A would like to import a product
from Country B where product-specific rules dictate that a maximum of 50% non-originating materials
is permitted in the item.
1. Only 35% of the components of the items were manufactured in Country B.
2. The trade deal between Country A and Country B permits components originating in Country C to count as originating
in Country B under certain circumstances, via **Extended Cumulation**, even though there is no Trade Agreement between
Country A and Country C.
4. Country B sources components from Country C that make up 20% of the total value of the product.
5. As 35% + 20% exceeds the 50% threshold, extended cumulation permits the trade to go ahead and for the preferential
tariff for trade in goods between Country A and Country B to be legitimately claimed.
