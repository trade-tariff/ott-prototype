Bilateral cumulation operates between 2 countries or trading blocs where a trade agreement contains a provision allowing them to cumulate origin.

Materials originating in either country in the trade agreement will be considered as materials covered by the rule of origin.

#### Bilateral cumulation - an example

Take a car, for example. If a UK company sourced all of the parts from across the EU and then put it all together in a factory in the UK, it could sell it back to a customer in the EU, taking advantage of the preferential zero tariff rate, as if all the bits of the car originated in the UK.
