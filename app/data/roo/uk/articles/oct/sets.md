Sets, as defined in General Rule 3 for the interpretation of the Harmonized System, will be regarded as originating when all the component products are originating products.
When a set is composed of originating and non-originating products, the set as a whole will however be regarded as originating, provided that the value of the non-originating products does not exceed 15 % of the ex-works price of the set.
