1. Without prejudice to paragraphs 5 and 6 of this Annex, products which are not wholly obtained in an Overseas Territory within the meaning of paragraph 3 of this Annex will be considered to originate there, provided that the provisions laid down in the list in Appendix II for the goods concerned are fulfilled.

2. If a product which has acquired originating status in an Overseas Territory in accordance with subparagraph 1 is further processed in that Overseas Territory and used as a material in the manufacture of another product, no account will be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

3. The determination of whether the requirements of subparagraph 1 are met, will be carried out for each product.

    However, where the relevant rule is based on compliance with a maximum content of non-originating materials, in order to take into account fluctuations in costs and currency rates, the value of the non-originating materials may be calculated on an average basis as set out in subparagraph 4.

4. Where the second subparagraph of subparagraph 3 applies, an average ex-works price of the product and average value of non-originating materials used will be calculated respectively on the basis of the sum of the ex-works prices charged for all sales of the products carried out during the preceding fiscal year and the sum of the value of all the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the products over the preceding fiscal year as defined in the country of export, or, where figures for a complete fiscal year are not available, a shorter period which should not be less than three months.

5. Exporters having opted for calculations on an average basis will consistently apply such a method during the year following the fiscal year of reference, or, where appropriate, during the year following the shorter period used as a reference. They may cease to apply such a method where during a given fiscal year, or a shorter representative period of no less than three months, they record that the fluctuations in costs or currency rates which justified the use of such a method have ceased.

6. The averages referred to in subparagraph 4 will be used as the ex-works price and the value of non-originating materials respectively, for the purpose of establishing compliance with the maximum content of non-originating materials.
