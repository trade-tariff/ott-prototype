1. By way of derogation from paragraph 4 of this Annex and subject to subparagraphs 2 and 3 of this paragraph, non-originating materials which, according to the provisions set out in the list in Appendix II are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:

   1. 15 % of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapter 2 and 4 to 24, other than processed fishery products in Chapter 16;

   2. 15 % of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Appendix I will apply.

2. Subparagraph 1 of this paragraph will not allow that any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Appendix II are exceeded.

3. Subparagraphs 1 and 2 of this paragraph will not apply to products wholly obtained in an Overseas Territory within the meaning of paragraph 3 of this Annex. However, without prejudice to paragraph 5 and paragraph 11(2) of this Annex, the tolerance provided for in subparagraphs 1 and 2 of this paragraph will nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Appendix I for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.
