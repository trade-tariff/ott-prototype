### Sufficiently worked or processed products

1. For the purposes of Article 2, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed, when the conditions set out in Annex II are fulfilled.

2. The conditions referred to in paragraph 1 above indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-EAC Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non-originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. Accordingly, it follows that if a product, which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in Annex II is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non-originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2, non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in Annex II should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total value or net weight assessed for the product does not exceed:

   1. 15 % of the weight of the product for products falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 of HS 2012, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;

   2. 15 % of the ex-works price of the product for other products, except for products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2012, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Part I of Annex II, shall apply.

4. Paragraph 3 shall not allow exceeding any of the percentages for the maximum content of non- originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Annex II.

5. Paragraphs 3 and 4 shall not apply to products wholly obtained within the meaning of Article 7. However, without prejudice to Article 9 and 10(1), the tolerance provided for in those paragraphs shall nevertheless apply to the sum of all the materials which are used in the manufacture of a product and for which the rule laid down in the list in Annex II for that product requires that such materials be wholly obtained.
