### Sufficiently worked or processed products

1. For the purposes of Article 2 of this Origin Reference Document, products which are not wholly obtained are considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in the list in Annex II to this Origin Reference Document are fulfilled.
2. For the purposes of Article 2 of this Origin Reference Document and notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article, the products which are listed in Annex II‐A to this Origin Reference Document can be considered to be sufficiently worked or processed when the conditions set out in that Annex are fulfilled. Annex II‐A to this Origin Reference Document shall apply only to exports from Ghana and for a period of five (5) years from the date of entry into force of Protocol No. 1 concerning the definition of the concept of 'originating products' and the methods of administrative cooperation to the EU-Ghana Free Trade Agreement. 
3. The conditions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article indicate, for all products covered by the United Kingdom-Ghana Agreement, the working or processing which must be carried out on non‐originating materials used in manufacturing and apply only in relation to such materials. It follows that if a product which has acquired originating status by fulfilling the conditions set out in one of the lists is used in the manufacture of another product, the conditions applicable to the product in which it is incorporated do not apply to it, and no account shall be taken of the non‐originating materials which may have been used in its manufacture.
4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article, non‐originating materials which, in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex II and Annex II‐A to this Origin Reference Document should not be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that:
(a) their total value does not exceed 15 % of the ex‐works price of the product;
(b) none of the percentages given in the list for the maximum value of non‐originating materials are exceeded through the application of this paragraph.
5. The provisions of paragraph 4 of this Article shall not apply to products of Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2012.
6. Paragraphs 1 to 5 of this Article shall apply subject to the provisions of Article 5 of this Origin Reference Document.
