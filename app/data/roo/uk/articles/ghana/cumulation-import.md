    Where the working or processing carried out in the Party concerned does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Origin Reference Document, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in that Party only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any of the other countries or territories. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country or territory which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture of the final product.

    The origin of materials originating in other ACP States having a preferential trade arrangement with the UK and in the OCTs shall be determined in accordance with the rules of origin applicable under the preferential arrangements between the UK and those countries, and in accordance with Article 27 of this Origin Reference Document.

    Where the working or processing carried out in one of the Parties does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 5(1) of this Origin Reference Document, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in that Party only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used in any one of these countries or territories. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country or territory which accounts for the highest value of materials used in the manufacture of the final product.

    The origin of the final product shall be determined according to the rules of origin of this Origin Reference Document and in accordance with Article 27 hereof.
