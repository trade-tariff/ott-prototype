The terms ‘their vessels’ and ‘their factory ships’ in paragraph 1(f) and (g) shall apply only to vessels and factory ships:

1. which are registered in the UK or an ESA State;

2. which sail under the flag of the UK or an ESA State; and

3. which meet one of the following conditions:

   1. they are at least 50 per cent owned by nationals of the UK, an EU Member State or an ESA State; or

   2. they are owned by companies:

      - which have their head office and their main place of business in the UK, an EU Member State or an ESA State; and

      - which are at least 50 per cent owned by the UK, an EU Member State or an ESA State, public entities or nationals of that State.

4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, the UK shall recognise, upon request of an ESA State, that vessels chartered or leased by the ESA State be treated as ‘their vessels’ to undertake fisheries activities in its exclusive economic zone provided that the charter or lease agreement, for which the UK has been offered the right of first refusal, has been accepted by the Customs Cooperation Committee as providing adequate opportunities for developing the capacity of the ESA State to fish on its own account and in particular, as conferring on the ESA State the responsibility for the nautical and commercial management of the vessel at its disposal for a significant period of time.

5. The conditions of paragraph 2 can be fulfilled in different States insofar as they belong to ESA States. In this case, products shall be deemed to have the origin of the State of the nationals or of companies to which the vessel or factory ship belongs in accordance with paragraph 2(c). In the event of a vessel or factory ship owned by nationals or companies of States belonging to different Economic Partnership Agreements, the products shall be deemed to have the origin of the State whose nationals or companies contribute to the highest share in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2(c).
