### Tolerance rule

1. By way of derogation from Article 4 and subject to paragraphs 2 and 3, non originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the list in Annex II, are not to be used in the manufacture of a given product may nevertheless be used, provided that their total net weight or value assessed for the product does not exceed:

    (a) 15 % of the net weight of the product falling within Chapters 2 and 4 to 24, other than processed fishery products of Chapter 16;

    (b) 15 % of the ex-works price of the product for products other than those covered by subparagraph (a).

    This paragraph shall not apply to products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 of HS 2017, for which the tolerances mentioned in Notes 6 and 7 of Annex I shall apply.

2. Paragraph 1 shall not allow to exceed any of the percentages for the maximum content of non-originating materials as specified in the rules laid down in the list in Annex II.

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to products wholly obtained in a Party within the meaning of Article 3. However, without prejudice to Article 6 and Article 9(1), the tolerance provided for in those provisions shall nevertheless apply to product for which the rule laid down in the list in Annex II requires that the materials which are used in the manufacture of that product are wholly obtained.
