### Cumulation of origin

1. Products shall be considered as originating in the exporting Party when exported to the other Party if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in that other Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII, provided that the working or processing carried out in the exporting Party goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

2. Where the working or processing carried out in the exporting Party does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 6, the product obtained by incorporating materials originating in the other Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII, shall be considered as originating in the exporting Party only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in that other Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII, which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in the exporting Party.

3. With the exclusion of products falling within Chapters 50 to 63, working or processing carried out in the Party other than the exporting Party or any of the countries referred to in Annex VIII shall be considered as having been carried out in the exporting Party when the products obtained undergo subsequent working or processing in this exporting Party.

4. For products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 and only for the purpose of bilateral trade between the Parties, working or processing carried out in the importing Party shall be considered as having been carried out in the exporting Party when the products undergo subsequent working or processing in this exporting Party.

    For the purpose of this paragraph, the participants in the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process and the Republic of Moldova are to be considered as one cumulation zone.

5. Each Party shall extend the application of paragraph 3 on importation of products falling within Chapters 50 to 63 unilaterally.

6. For the purpose of cumulation within the meaning of paragraphs 3 and 4, the originating products shall be considered as originating in the exporting Party only if the working or processing undergone there goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6.

7. Products originating in either Party, or any country referred to in Annex VIII, which do not undergo any working or processing in the exporting Party shall retain their origin if exported into the other Party.
