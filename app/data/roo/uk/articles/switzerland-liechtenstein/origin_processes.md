## Article 17 - General requirements

1. Products originating in one of the Parties shall, on importation into the other Party, benefit from the provisions of the United Kingdom-Switzerland Agreement upon submission of one of the following proofs of origin: 

   1. a movement certificate EUR.1, a specimen of which appears in Annex IV to this Origin Reference Document;

   2. in the cases specified in Article 18(1), a declaration, subsequently referred to as the “origin declaration” given by the exporter on an invoice, a delivery note or any other commercial document which describes the products concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified; the text of the origin declaration appears in Annex III to this Origin Reference Document.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, originating products within the meaning of this Origin Reference Document shall, in the cases specified in Article 27, benefit from the provisions of the United Kingdom-Switzerland Agreement without it being necessary to submit any of the proofs of origin referred to in paragraph 1.

3. Without prejudice to paragraph 1, the Parties may agree that, for the preferential trade between them, proofs of origin listed in subparagraphs (a) and (b) of paragraph 1 are replaced by statements on origin made out by exporters registered in an electronic database in accordance with the domestic legislation of the Parties.

    The use of a statement on origin made out by the exporters registered in an electronic database agreed between the Parties, between a Party and any country referred to in Annex VIII or between countries referred to Annex VIII shall not impede the use of cumulation with a Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII.

4. For the purpose of Article 7, if Article 8(5) applies, the exporter established in a Party who issues a proof of origin on the basis of another proof of origin which benefits from a waiver from the obligation to include the statement as otherwise required by Article 8(4) shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the conditions for applying cumulation are fulfilled and shall be prepared to submit all relevant documents to the customs authorities.

## Article 18 - Conditions for making out an origin declaration

1. An origin declaration as referred to in subparagraph (b) of Article 17(1) may be made out:

   1. by an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 19; or

   2. by any exporter for any consignment consisting of one or more packages containing originating products the total value of which does not exceed EUR 6 000.

2. An origin declaration may be made out if the products can be considered as originating in a Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. The exporter making out an origin declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the exporting Party, all appropriate documents proving the originating status of the products concerned as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

4. An origin declaration shall be made out by the exporter by typing, stamping or printing on the invoice, the delivery note or another commercial document, the declaration, the text of which appears in Annex III to this Origin Reference Document, using one of the linguistic versions set out in that Annex and in accordance with the provisions of the national law of the exporting country. If the declaration is handwritten, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.

5. Origin declarations shall bear the signature of the exporter in manuscript. However, an approved exporter within the meaning of Article 19 shall not be required to sign such declarations provided that he gives the customs authorities of the exporting Party a written undertaking that he accepts full responsibility for any origin declaration which identifies him as if it had been signed in manuscript by him. Each Party shall permit an origin declaration to be sent electronically and directly from the exporter in one Party to an importer in the other Party. Such an approach will allow the use of electronic signatures or identification codes.

6. An origin declaration may be made out by the exporter when the products to which it relates are exported, or after exportation (the “retrospective origin declaration”) on condition that it is presented in the importing country within two years after the importation of the products to which it relates.

    Where the splitting of a consignment takes place in accordance with Article 14(3) and provided that the same two-year deadline is respected, the retrospective origin declaration shall be made out by the approved exporter of the exporting Party of the products.

## Article 19 - Approved exporter

1. The customs authorities of the exporting Party may, subject to national requirements, authorise any exporter established in that Party (the “approved exporter”), to make out origin declarations irrespective of the value of the products concerned.

2. An exporter who requests such authorisation must offer, to the satisfaction of the customs authorities, all guarantees necessary to verify the originating status of the products as well as the fulfilment of the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. The customs authorities shall grant to the approved exporter a customs authorisation number which shall appear on the origin declaration.

4. The customs authorities shall verify the proper use of an authorisation. They may withdraw the authorisation if the approved exporter makes improper use of it and shall do so if the approved exporter no longer offers the guarantees referred to in paragraph 2.

## Article 29 - Supplier’s declarations

1. When a movement certificate EUR.1 is issued or an origin declaration is made out in a Party for originating products, in the manufacture of which goods imported from the other Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII which have undergone working or processing there without having obtained preferential originating status have been used in accordance with Article 7(3) or Article 7(4), account shall be taken of the supplier’s declaration given for those goods in accordance with this Article.

2. The supplier’s declaration referred to in paragraph 1 shall serve as evidence of the working or processing undergone in a Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII of the goods concerned, for the purpose of determining whether the products in the manufacture of which those goods are used, may be considered as products originating in the exporting Party and fulfil the other requirements of this Origin Reference Document.

3. A separate supplier’s declaration shall, except in the cases referred to in paragraph 4, be made out by the supplier for each consignment of goods in the form prescribed in Annex VI on a sheet of paper annexed to the invoice, the delivery note or any other commercial document describing the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.

4. Where a supplier regularly supplies a particular customer with goods for which the working or processing undergone in a Party or any country referred to in Annex VIII is expected to remain constant for a period of time, he may provide a single supplier’s declaration to cover subsequent consignments of those goods (the “long-term supplier’s declaration”). A long term supplier’s declaration may normally be valid for a period of up to two years from the date of making out the declaration. The customs authorities of the Party or the relevant country referred to in Annex VIII where the declaration is made out lay down the conditions under which longer periods may be used. The long-term supplier’s declaration shall be made out by the supplier in the form prescribed in Annex VII and shall describe the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified. It shall be provided to the customer concerned before he is supplied with the first consignment of goods covered by that declaration or together with his first consignment. The supplier shall inform his customer immediately if the long-term supplier’s declaration is no longer applicable to the goods supplied.

5. The supplier’s declarations referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 shall be typed or printed using an official language of a Party or the relevant country referred to in Annex VIII, in accordance with the national law of that Party or country where the declaration is made out, and shall bear the original signature of the supplier in manuscript. The declaration may also be handwritten; in such a case, it shall be written in ink in printed characters.

6. The supplier making out a declaration shall be prepared to submit at any time, at the request of the customs authorities of the Party or the relevant country referred to in Annex VIII where the declaration is made out, all appropriate documents proving that the information given on that declaration is correct.

## Article 30 - Amounts expressed in euro

1. For the purposes of application of the subparagraph (b) of Article 18(1) and Article 27(3) in cases where products are invoiced in a currency other than euro, amounts in the national currencies of a Party equivalent to the amounts expressed in euro shall be fixed annually by that Party.

2. A consignment shall benefit from the subparagraph (b) of Article 18(1) or Article 27(3) by reference to the currency in which the invoice is drawn up, according to the amount fixed by the Party concerned.

3. The amounts to be used in any given national currency shall be the equivalent in that currency of the amounts expressed in euro as at the first working day of October and shall apply from 1 January the following year. The Parties shall notify each other of the relevant amounts.

4. A Party may round up or down the amount resulting from the conversion into its national currency of an amount expressed in euro. The rounded-off amount may not differ from the amount resulting from the conversion by more than 5 %. A Party may retain unchanged its national currency equivalent of an amount expressed in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment provided for in paragraph 3, the conversion of that amount, prior to any rounding-off, results in an increase of less than 15 % in the national currency equivalent. The national currency equivalent may be retained unchanged if the conversion were to result in a decrease in that equivalent value.

5. The amounts expressed in euro shall be reviewed by the Joint Committee at the request of a Party. When carrying out that review, the Joint Committee shall consider the desirability of preserving the effects of the limits concerned in real terms. For that purpose, it may decide to modify the amounts expressed in euro.
