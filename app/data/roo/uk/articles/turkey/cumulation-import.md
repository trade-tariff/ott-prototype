### Cumulation of origin

1. A product originating in a Party shall be considered as originating in the other Party if that product is used as a material in the production of another product in that other Party. 

2. Production carried out in a Party on a non-originating material may be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether a product is originating in the other Party. 

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 do not apply if the production carried out in the other Party does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient production).  

4. Without prejudice to Article 2(1), products shall be considered as originating in a Party, if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the European Union, provided that the working or processing carried out in a Party goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 6 (Insufficient production). It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

5. In order for an exporter to complete the origin declaration referred to in Article 18(1)(a) for a product referred to in paragraph 2, the exporter shall obtain from its supplier a supplier's declaration as provided for in Annex 3 (Supplier's Declaration) or an equivalent document that contains the same information describing the non-originating materials concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified.
