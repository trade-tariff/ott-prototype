In order to benefit from the provisions of paragraph 3(a), two (2) months before the start of the fishing season Namibia shall submit a report on the application of paragraph 3(a) and notify to the UK the vessels operating under paragraph 3 in that particular fishing season. If, two (2) months before the start of the fishing season, Namibia submits the complete report on the application of paragraph 3(a) and notifies the above mentioned vessels, the UK shall, before the start of the fishing season, make the details of the notified vessels and the date from which paragraph 3(a) shall be applicable to those vessels publically available. 

   3. The Committee shall be informed by Namibia of any change in its legislation concerning fishing activities and on whether the conditions for the application of paragraph 3(a) are met after the legislative changes.

   5. In case the number of vessels operating under paragraph 3(a) is considered to be unusually high as compared to previous years' operations, the UK could raise this matter with the Committee to adopt appropriate measures to remedy the situation.

   6. Any of the Parties can refer matters concerning the application of paragraphs 3(a) to 3(e) the Joint Council if no satisfactory decision concerning the application of these provisions is adopted by the Committee. Once a matter concerning the application of paragraphs 3(a) to 3(e) is referred to the Joint Council, the Joint Council shall come to a decision within one hundred and eighty (180) days. If the Joint Council is unable to reach a decision within one hundred and eighty (180) days, the derogation provided for in paragraph 3 shall be suspended until an agreement is reached. A party may also decide to refer the matter to the dispute settlement mechanism of the Agreement, as provided for in Article PART III of the Agreement, if no satisfactory solution is found within the Joint Council.
