## Claims for preferential tariff treatment

Unless otherwise specified, a claim for the preferential tariff treatment of goods meeting the requirements of the Origin Regulations must be made on the basis of a proof of origin made out by the exporter and must take the form of either:

- an **origin declaration** provided on an invoice or any other commercial document that describes the goods concerned in sufficient detail to enable them to be identified and contains:
  - the statement set out in Annex B
  - the data elements identified in that Annex; *or*

- **Form A** made out in accordance with Annex A.

A claim for preferential tariff treatment must be included in the customs import declaration.

By way of derogation, if an importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, HMRC will grant preferential tariff treatment and repay or remit any excess customs duty paid provided that:

- the claim for preferential tariff treatment is made no later than two years after the date of importation; 

- the importer provides a valid proof of origin; *and*

- the goods would have been regarded as originating from the beneficiary country under the Origin Regulations and would have satisfied all the requirements of this notice had the claim been made by the importer at the time of importation.

## Conditions for making out a proof of origin

- maintains appropriate commercial accounting records concerning the production and supply of goods qualifying for preferential tariff treatment
