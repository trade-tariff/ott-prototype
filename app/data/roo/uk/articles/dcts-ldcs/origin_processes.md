## Validity of a proof of origin
A proof of origin shall be valid for a period expiring two years after the date on which it was made out and may be presented to HMRC within this period.

Proofs of origin submitted after the expiry of their validity period may be accepted where the failure to submit them is due to exceptional circumstances.

Proofs of origin may apply to:

- a single shipment of originating goods

- multiple shipments of identical goods which:

  - are imported within the framework of frequent and continuous trade flows of a significant commercial value not exceeding 12 months

  - are the subject of the same contract of sale

  - are classified in the same code (eight digits) of the Combined Nomenclature

  - come exclusively from the same exporter, are destined for the same importer, and are made the subject of entry formalities at the same customs office in the UK

On request of the importer, where unassembled or disassembled products falling within Section XVI or XVII or heading 7308 or 9406 of the Harmonised System are imported in instalments for transport or production reasons, a single proof of origin for such products may be used in accordance with the requirements laid down by HMRC.
 
## Exemptions from proof of origin requirements

Personal goods and those imported by way of trade shall be exempted from the obligation to make out and produce a proof of origin:

The goods referred to above must meet the following conditions:

- their total value does not exceed £1000

- they have been declared as meeting the conditions for benefiting from the Origin Regulations

- there is no doubt as to the veracity of that declaration

## Discrepancies and errors
 
- Slight discrepancies discovered between the statements made in an origin declaration and those made in the documents submitted to the customs office for the purpose of carrying out the formalities for importing the goods shall not in themselves render the origin declaration null and void if it is duly established that that it does correspond to the goods submitted.

- Obvious errors on an origin declaration shall not cause it to be rejected if these errors are not such as to create doubts concerning the correctness of the statements made.

## Replacement of origin declarations

Where originating DCTS goods not yet released for free circulation in the UK are placed under customs control, the UK re-consignor may replace the initial origin declaration (origin declaration or Form A) by one or more replacement origin declarations for the purposes of sending all or some of the products to Switzerland.

Where an origin declaration is replaced, the UK re-consignor shall indicate the following on the initial origin declaration:

- the particulars of the replacement origin declaration

- their name and address

- the name and address of the consignee or consignees in Switzerland

The initial origin declaration must be marked “Replaced”.

The re-consignor shall indicate the following on the replacement origin declaration:

- all the particulars of the re-consigned goods taken from the initial origin declaration issued by the beneficiary country

- the date on which the initial origin declaration was made out

- the particulars of the initial origin declaration including references to any cumulation

- their name, address and Economic Operator Registration Identification (EORI) number

- the name and address of the consignee or consignees in Switzerland

The replacement statement on origin must be marked “Replacement”

Re-consignments from Switzerland shall be accompanied by an origin declaration in the form of a statement on origin made out by a Registered Exporter.]

## Annex A - Form A

Form A (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/completing-generalised-scheme-of-preferences-form-a) must bear a serial number, printed or otherwise, or, where there is no serial number, a reference to the commercial invoice by which it can be identified does not need to be stamped and signed by an authority designated by the beneficiary country, so does not need to be an original.

|Box|Detail|
|-|-|
|Box&nbsp;1|Enter the full name and business address of the exporter.|
|Box&nbsp;2|**Consignee**<br>The completion of this box is optional, but you are recommended to enter the name and address of the consignee where this is known. For exports to exhibitions which are later sent on to the UK, insert also the name and address of the exhibition.|
|Box&nbsp;3|**Transport details**<br>You should complete this box on the basis of available information. If you do not have details of the transport arrangements, then leave this box blank.|
|Box&nbsp;4|**For official use**<br>This box is reserved for the use of the certifying authority. However, if the Form A has been made out after the goods have been shipped, stamp or write “Issued Retrospectively”.|
|Box&nbsp;5|**Item number**<br>If different types of goods are shown separately on the invoice(s), show each type separately on the Form A and itemise them (1, 2, 3 etc), so they can be cross-checked to the invoice if necessary.|
|Box&nbsp;6|**Marks and numbers**<br>Enter the identifying marks and numbers that appear on the packages. If the packages are marked with the address of the consignee, state the address. If they are not marked in any way, put 'No marks and numbers'. If both originating and non-originating goods are packed together, add 'Part contents only' at the end of each entry.
|Box&nbsp;7|**Number and kind of packages, description of goods**<br><br>**Bulk Goods**<br>Identify the goods by giving a reasonably full commercial description e.g. 'photocopiers' or 'typewriters' rather than 'office machinery'. However, if the invoices give full identifying details (which need not necessarily include details of the marks and numbers of the packages) only a general description is needed. For goods in bulk which are not individually packed, insert 'In bulk'. The quantity shown must be the same as, or relatable to, the quantity shown on the invoice for the goods (e.g. if the invoice shows 100 cartons and these are loaded on to 10 pallets, specify '100 cartons' NOT '10 pallets').<br><br>**Mixed consignments**<br>For consignments containing both originating and non-originating goods, describe only the originating goods on the Form A. You may be unable to avoid showing originating and non- originating goods on the same invoice. In this case, mark the invoice (for example, with an asterisk) to show which goods are non-originating and put an appropriate statement in Box 7 immediately below the description of the goods, e.g. 'Goods marked * on the invoice are non-originating and are not covered by this Form A'. The same considerations will apply if you have a mixed consignment of goods qualifying by virtue of a derogation and others which are not covered by that derogation.<br><br>**Unused space**<br>Draw a horizontal line under the final item in this box and rule through the unused space with a 'Z-shaped' line.|
|Box&nbsp;8|**Origin criterion**<br>This box signifies to HMRC which origin rule has been applied to the goods. As described in the note about it on the reverse of the Form A, enter the code:<br><br>- “P” for wholly obtained goods and<br>- “W”, followed by the heading, where the goods have been sufficiently processed.<br><br>For example:  for wholly obtained goods of, say, heading 96.18, the indication should read: "P" and for sufficiently processed goods of the same heading, it should read: "W” 96.18.<br><br>Failure to complete this box correctly could lead to the rejection of the Form A.|
|Box&nbsp;9|**Gross weight or other quantity**<br>Insert the quantity in metric units (e.g. kilograms, litres etc).|
|Box&nbsp;10|**Number and date of invoice**<br>You are recommended to enter the details of the commercial invoice as this ensures the signatory has verified the ex-works price.|
|Box&nbsp;11|**Certification**<br>This field may be left blank. The UK no longer requires the Form A to be certified by a designated authority in the exporting GSP country.
|Box&nbsp;12|**Declaration by the exporter**<br>Complete this box by inserting the name of the country in which the goods are considered to have originated. You should take into account that where the provisions for regional cumulation have been applied, that country may not be the same as the country of final processing or the country of exportation.<br><br>For the importing country you must put 'United Kingdom'; indicating a different importing country (e.g. European Union) will lead to the Form A not being accepted. Only the exporter, or a person duly authorised by the exporter, can sign this declaration.<br><br>Forwarding agents acting simply in that capacity are not exporters and must not sign this box. By signing this form, you declare that the goods qualify under the provisions of the Trade Preference Scheme (Developing Countries Trading Scheme) Regulations 2023 and the Customs (Origin of Chargeable Goods: Developing Countries Trading Scheme)) Regulations 2023. If the declaration is incorrect, you will have committed an offence which may incur penalties.|
