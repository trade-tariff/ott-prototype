## Note 4 - Tolerances applicable to goods made of a mixture of textile materials

4.1.  Where, in relation to a good in the table in Part 2 or 3, reference is made to this Note, the conditions set out in Column 3 are not required to be applied to any basic textile materials used in the manufacture of the good and which, taken together, represent 10% or less of the total weight of all the basic textile materials used (see also Notes 4.3 and 4.4).

4.2.  However, the tolerance mentioned in Note 4.1 may be applied only to mixed goods which have been made from two or more basic textile materials. The following are the basic textile materials:

- silk;

- wool;

- coarse animal hair;

- fine animal hair;

- horsehair;

- cotton;

- paper-making materials and paper;

- flax;

- true hemp;

- jute and other textile bast fibres;

- sisal and other textile fibres of the genus Agave;

- coconut, abaca, ramie, and other vegetable textile fibres;

- synthetic man-made filaments;

- artificial man-made filaments;

- current-conducting filaments;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polypropylene;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyester;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyamide;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyacrylonitrile;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polyimide;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of polytetrafluoroethylene;

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(phenylene sulphide);

- synthetic man-made staple fibres of poly(vinyl chloride);

- other synthetic man-made staple fibres;

- artificial man-made staple fibres of viscose;

- other artificial man-made staple fibres;

- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped;

- yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyester, whether or not gimped;

- goods of heading 5605 incorporating strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film;

- other goods of heading 5605;

- glass fibres;

- metal fibres.

Example:

A yarn, of heading 5205, made from cotton fibres of heading 5203 and synthetic staple fibres of heading 5506, is a mixed yarn. Therefore, non-originating materials which are synthetic staple fibres which do not satisfy the conditions may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the yarn.

Example:

A woollen fabric, of heading 5112, made from woollen yarn of heading 5107 and synthetic yarn of staple fibres of heading 5509, is a mixed fabric. Therefore, synthetic yarn which does not satisfy the conditions, or woollen yarn which does not satisfy the conditions, or a combination of the two, may be used, provided that their total weight does not exceed 10% of the weight of the fabric.

4.3.  In the case of goods incorporating “yarn made of polyurethane segmented with flexible segments of polyether, whether or not gimped”, the tolerance is 20% in respect of this yarn.

4.4.  In the case of goods incorporating “strip consisting of a core of aluminium foil or of a core of plastic film whether or not coated with aluminium powder, of a width not exceeding 5 mm, sandwiched by means of a transparent or coloured adhesive between two layers of plastic film”, the tolerance is 30% in respect of this strip.

## Note 5 — Other tolerances applicable to certain textile goods

5.1.  Where, in the table in Part 2 or 3, reference is made to this Note, textile materials which do not satisfy the condition set out in Column 3 for the made-up good concerned, may be used, provided that they are classified in a heading other than that of the good and that their value does not exceed 8% of the ex-works price of the good.

5.2.  Without prejudice to Note 5.3, materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 may be used freely in the manufacture of textile goods, whether or not they contain textiles.

Example:

If a condition in the tables provides that, for a particular textile item (such as trousers), yarn must be used, this does not prevent the use of metal items, such as buttons, because buttons are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63. For the same reason, it does not prevent the use of slide-fasteners, even though slide-fasteners normally contain textiles.

5.3.  Where a percentage-rule applies, the value of non-originating materials which are not classified within Chapters 50 to 63 must be taken into account when calculating the value of the non-originating materials incorporated.
