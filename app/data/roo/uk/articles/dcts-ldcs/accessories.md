## 9. Valuation

1. “Value”, in relation to a material, means—

    (a) the customs value, as determined in accordance with Article VII of GATT, at the time of importation of the material, or

    (b) if that customs value is not known and cannot be ascertained, the first price proven, to the satisfaction of an HMRC officer, to have been paid for the material in the United Kingdom or in the qualifying DCTS country concerned.

    (2) When calculating the value of non-originating material in relation to a good obtained in an LDC, the costs of freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer of the good may be deducted.

    (3) In paragraph (1) (a) , “GATT” means the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT) (being part of Annex 1A to the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO) signed in Marrakesh on 15th April 1994(7) ).

## 10. Averages

1. Where the conditions specified in the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1 refer to a maximum content of non-originating materials, this may be determined by reference to —

    (a) the average ex-works price charged for goods sold during the reference period, *and*

    (b) the average value of the non-originating materials used in the manufacture of the goods during the reference period.

2. An exporter who has applied the method of determination set out in paragraph (1) must apply the same method in respect of the fiscal year following the reference period.

3. But the exporter may cease to apply that method if, during a given fiscal year or shorter period of at least three months, the exporter records that fluctuations in costs or currency rates which justified such a method have ceased.

4. In this regulation—

    “fiscal year” means the year, beginning with the same date each year, defined by the exporter;

    “reference period” means the preceding fiscal year or, where figures for a complete preceding fiscal year are not available, a shorter period of at least three months in the preceding fiscal year.

## 11. Derogation in respect of use of non-originating materials

1. Non-originating materials which, according to the conditions set out in the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1, are not to be used in the manufacture of the goods, may nevertheless be used provided that—

   - (a) in relation to goods falling within any of Chapters 2 and 4 to 24 except processed fishery goods mentioned in Chapter 16, the net weight of the non-originating materials does not exceed 15% of the net weight of the goods;

   - (b) in relation to goods to which sub-paragraph (a) does not apply except goods falling within any of Chapters 50 to 63, for which the allowances mentioned in Notes 4 and 5 of Part 1 of Schedule 1 apply, the total value of the non-originating materials does not exceed 15% of the ex-works price of the goods;

   - (c) the percentage for the maximum content of non-originating materials in relation to the goods as specified in the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1 is not exceeded.

2. Paragraph (1) does not apply in relation to goods which are to be regarded as wholly obtained in a qualifying DCTS country under regulation 7.

3. The allowance under the derogation in paragraph (1) applies to the sum of all the materials used in the manufacture of the goods where the condition in respect of those goods as set out in the tables in Part 2 and Part 3 of Schedule 1 is that such materials be wholly obtained in the qualifying DCTS country, but this does not affect the application of regulations 8(2) and 12(1) .

## 12. Consignments of identical goods and packaging

1. For the purposes of these Regulations, if a consignment consists of several goods, the origin of each good must be individually determined, including where the consignment consists of substantively identical goods classified under the same sub-heading.

2. If, under Rule 5 of the Goods Classification Table Rules of Interpretation specified in section 1 of Part Two of the Tariff of the United Kingdom, packaging is included with the goods for classification purposes, it must be included in determining the origin of the goods.

3. In this regulation, “the Tariff of the United Kingdom” has the meaning given in regulation 1(2) of the Tariff Regulations.

## 13. Accessories, spare parts and tools dispatched with a piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle which are part of the normal equipment and included in its price or which are not separately invoiced:

- (a) are to be regarded as having the same origin as the piece of equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle;

- (b) may be taken into account when determining the originating status of the equipment, machine, apparatus or vehicle under regulation 4.
