1. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2), products shall be considered as originating in Tunisia if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in the United Kingdom, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein), Iceland, Norway, Turkey or the European Union, provided that the working or processing carried out in Tunisia goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

2. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2(2), products shall be considered as originating in Tunisia if they are obtained there, incorporating materials originating in any of the ‘Contracting Parties’  (other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article) to the Regional Convention on Pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin, provided that the working or processing carried out in Tunisia goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7. It shall not be necessary for such materials to have undergone sufficient working or processing.

Where the working or processing carried out in Tunisia does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in Tunisia only where the value added there is greater than the value of the materials used originating in any one of the other countries referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. If this is not so, the product obtained shall be considered as originating in the country which accounts for the highest value of originating materials used in the manufacture in Tunisia.

Where, pursuant to this provision, the originating products are obtained in two or more of the countries concerned, they shall be considered as originating in Tunisia only if the working or processing goes beyond the operations referred to in Article 7.
