### Cumulation of origin

1. A product that originates in a Party is considered originating in the other Party when used as a material in the production of a product in that other Party.

2. An exporter may take into account production carried out on a non-originating material in the other Party for the purposes of determining the originating status of a product.

   1. For the purposes of paragraph 1, a material produced in the EU that would have satisfied the rules of origin had the territory of the EU been part of the free trade area established by United Kingdom-Canada Agreement shall be deemed as originating when used in the production of a product in a Party.

   2. For the purposes of determining the originating status of a product, an exporter may take into account production carried out on a non-originating material in the territory of the EU.

   3. Paragraphs 2A and 2B will cease to apply three years after the date of entry into force of the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement. Not more than 30 months after the entry into force of the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement the Parties shall discuss and decide whether the period should be extended.  If they agree, the application of paragraphs 2A and 2B may be extended by decision of the Canada UK Joint Committee.

3. Paragraphs 1 through 2B do not apply if the production carried out on a product does not go beyond the operations referred to in Article 7 and the object of this production, as demonstrated on the basis of a preponderance of evidence, is to circumvent financial or fiscal legislation of the Parties.

4. If an exporter has completed an origin declaration for a product referred to in paragraphs 2 or 2B, the exporter must possess a completed and signed supplier's statement from the supplier of the non-originating materials used in the production of the product.

5. A supplier's statement may be the statement set out in Annex 3 or an equivalent document that contains the same information describing the non-originating materials concerned in sufficient detail for their identification.

6. If a supplier's statement referred to in paragraph 4  is in electronic format, it does not need to be signed, provided that the supplier is identified to the satisfaction of the customs authorities in the Party where the supplier's statement was completed.

7. A supplier's statement applies to a single invoice or multiple invoices for the same material that is supplied within a period that does not exceed 12 months from the date set out in the supplier's statement.

8. Subject to paragraph 9, if, as permitted by the WTO Agreement, each Party has a free trade agreement with the same third country, a material of that third country may be taken into consideration by the exporter when determining whether a product is originating under the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement.

9. Each Party shall apply paragraph 8  only if equivalent provisions are in force between each Party and the third country and upon agreement by the Parties on the applicable conditions.

10. Notwithstanding paragraph 9, if each Party has a free trade agreement with the United States, and upon agreement by both Parties on the applicable conditions, each Party shall apply paragraph 8 when determining whether a product of Chapter 2 or 11, heading 16.01 through 16.03, Chapter 19, heading 20.02 or 20.03, or subheading 3505.10 is originating under the United Kingdom-Canada Agreement.
