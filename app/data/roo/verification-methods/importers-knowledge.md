'Importer's knowledge' is an option that allows the importer to claim preferential tariff treatment based on their own knowledge about the originating status of imported products. It can be used as an alternative to a statement on origin provided by the exporter.

As the importer is making a claim using their own knowledge, the exporter or producer does not need to do anything to officially state the originating status of the goods.

As this option requires the importer to have knowledge that the products meet the relevant rules of origin, the exporter or producer may have to provide information about the production to the importer. This may be in addition to other information (such as supporting documents or records) which the importer may already have.

The information could include:

- the Harmonized System code of the product and origin criteria used
- a brief description of the production process
- if the origin criterion was based on a specific production process, a specific description of that process
- if applicable, a description of the originating and non-originating materials used in the production process
- if the origin criterion was 'wholly obtained', the applicable category (such as harvesting, mining, or fishing; and the place of production)
- if the origin criterion was based on a value method, the value of the product as well as the value of all the non-originating and/or originating materials used in the production
- if the origin criterion was based on weight, the weight of the product as well as the weight of the relevant non-originating and/or originating materials used in the product
- if the origin criterion was based on a change in tariff classification, a list of all the non-originating materials including their tariff classification number under the Harmonized System (in 2, 4 or 6-digit format depending on the origin criteria)
- the information relating to the compliance with the provision on non-alteration (if applicable), for example a certificate of non-manipulation from the Customs Authority in the country of transit

If the importer cannot get the information - including when the exporter or producer does not provide the information because it is deemed commercially sensitive - preferential tariff treatment may still be claimed if the exporter issues a statement on origin.

An importer making a claim for preferential tariff treatment must keep all records that show that the product is eligible for preference for 4 years from the date of importation. These records may be stored in an electronic format.
