Depending on the trade agreement, you may only be able to use an origin declaration for consignments over £5,500 if you have [applied and received approved exporter status](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/import-and-export-application-for-approved-exporter-status-c1454).

If you have approved exporter status you will not need to present the origin declaration to HMRC to be checked before exporting to:

- customs
- a Chamber of Commerce office
- an Institute of Chartered Shipbrokers office

To apply, you must prove to HMRC that:

- you export or intend to export goods on a regular basis
- the goods to be exported meet the relevant origin rules to qualify for the issue of preference documents
- you will correctly complete the documents and take proper care of them

If you’re an approved exporter, you can complete an origin declaration without a signature if you confirm in writing that you accept full responsibility for the declaration. You must have been given approval by HMRC (known as a ‘signature waiver’) to do this as part of getting approved exporter status.
