One option for claiming preference is for the importer to use a 'statement on origin' made out by the exporter. A statement on origin is not a document, but a prescribed text which the exporter added to the invoice or any other commercial document that describes the originating product in enough detail to allow it to be identified. The statement or document may be in an electronic format.

An exporter completing a statement on origin must hold information showing that the product is originating, including information on the originating status of materials used in the production of the product. This may include declarations obtained from their suppliers (supplierâ€™s declarations).

A statement on origin may apply to either:

- a single consignment
- multiple shipments of identical products within any period specified in the statement on origin but not more than 12 months from the date of the first import

If an exporter that has completed a statement on origin becomes aware or has reason to believe that it contains incorrect information, they must immediately notify their customer in writing.
