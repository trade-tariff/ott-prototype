You can make an origin declaration (also known as an 'invoice declaration' or 'statement on origin') on a commercial document that has enough detail in it to identify the origin of the goods. The document could be:

- an invoice
- a packing list
- a delivery note

If your commercial document does not have enough space to include all the information, you can include it on a separate letter-headed continuation paper. A letter-headed paper on its own will not be accepted. The commercial document and continuation paper must clearly refer to each other.

You can claim preference for different goods on the same document. Youâ€™ll need to clearly identify and show the goods that are originating and non-originating.

Origin declarations must be presented to HMRC within 2 years of the date your goods were imported.
