This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties, but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse for goods which are being released from a Free Zone (FZ).

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC) in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

A Free Zone (FZ) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in [Notice 3001](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code).

The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the Free Zone Operator for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure. The Free Zone Operator must also be provided with confirmation of receipt of the goods into the Excise Warehouse.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/11).
