Where the DE 1/10 completion notes contain different instruction from the main Declaration Completion Guide or other Appendices, the completion instructions in Appendix 1 take precedence. Where information may be entered at Header or Item level:

*   It may only be entered at header level where it applies equally to every goods item
*   Information must be entered at item level where it differs for even a single goods item
*   It must be entered at item level where it would result in an incorrect duty calculation if only entered at header level, for example, a proportional reduction in air freight charges by gross weight.

However, please note that while DE 3/39, 8/2 and 8/3 are header level only data elements, they do not have to apply equally to all items on a declaration.
