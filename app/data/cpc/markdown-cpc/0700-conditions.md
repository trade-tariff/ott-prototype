This Procedure Code is used where the goods are released for free circulation but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/11).
