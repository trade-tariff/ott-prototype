Goods must be intended for onward dispatch to another Customs Union Territory at the time this procedure is requested: The goods must be onward dispatched:

*   Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure
*   In an unaltered state from the time of their entry to inward processing. Where the goods are diverted from IP, the goods subject to the onward dispatch must have been diverted unprocessed. Where the goods were processed under IP they are not eligible for onward dispatch relief.

Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in DE 2/3 (Document Codes). Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (IP) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see DE 2/3 Document Codes).

The use of this procedure is subject to a full multi-state authorisation being held for IP at the time the goods were entered to IP.

Authorisation by Customs Declaration cannot be used with this Procedure Code.

Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

This Procedure Code may not be used with Simplified Declaration Procedure (SDP) or Entry in Declarantâ€™s Records (EIDR).
