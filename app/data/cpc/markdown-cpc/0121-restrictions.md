Goods must be intended for onward dispatch to another Customs Union Territory at the time this procedure is requested. The goods must be onward dispatched:

*   Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure
*   In an unaltered state from the time of release to this procedure

Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in DE 2/3 (Document Codes).

Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Outward Processing (OP) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see DE 2/3 Document Codes).

The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under OP.

Goods temporarily exported for processing under VAT only OP (DE 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) may not be re-imported using this Procedure Code.

Where the Additional Declaration Type code used in DE 1/2 is: C, F or Y, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (SDP) must also be held.

Additional Declaration Types (DE 1/2): C, F or Y cannot be used where use of the previous procedure (OP) was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration AI code 00100 in DE 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in DE 1/2 on this declaration.

Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occur within the same Member State.

Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarantâ€™s Records (EIDR).
