This Procedure Code is used to claim customs duty relief on goods re-imported under the outward processing (OP) procedure with simultaneous release for free circulation but where excise duties (and where applicable VAT) are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

An OP authorisation, valid at the time of export, is needed to use this customs procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in [Notice 3001](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code).

Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the person who originally exported the goods under OP.

VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union.

See conditions for use detailed in Notice 3001.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/11).
