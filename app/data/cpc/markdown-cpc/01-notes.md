The completion notes in this Appendix are a supplement to the main UK Trade Tariff, CDS Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide.

This Appendix only contains any additional completion notes for each 4-digit Procedure Code and does not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.

Only one 4-digit Procedure Code can be declared against each goods item in DE 1/10, however, this may be tailored to the specific circumstances for the goods treatment by the use of multiple Additional Procedure Codes in DE 1/11.

These completion notes are supplemented by the DE 1/11 Additional Procedure Code Notes and therefore any instructions relating to the Additional Procedure Code (3-digit code for DE 1/11) are not included here and must be read in addition to this Appendix.
