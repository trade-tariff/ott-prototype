This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation and dispatch to another territory in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a customs union for goods which were previously entered to inward processing (IP). These goods are then the subject of a VAT-exempt supply to another Customs Union Territory and, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension. The VAT and applicable excise duty will be due in the Customs Union Territory of final destination.

For territories which fall within the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC, use of this procedure code is dependent on complying with the conditions laid down for an onward dispatch, for example, completion of movement of goods in excise suspense requirements.

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

An Inward Processing (IP) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to IP, is needed to use this procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in [Notice 3001](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code).

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/11).
