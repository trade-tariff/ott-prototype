This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties, on goods which have previously been entered to Inward Processing in another member state, with simultaneous release for free circulation but where excise duties are suspended by entering them into an approved excise warehouse.

Any customs duties and import VAT must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

A full, multi-state Inward Processing (IP) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to IP, is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in [Notice 3001](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code).

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/11).
