 Description of procedure:
</h3>
<p>
 The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.
</p>
<p>
 Release for free circulation of goods simultaneously re-dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a customs union and where the goods are being re-imported following temporary export under outward processing (Articles 259 - 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (
 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">
  UCC
 </abbr>
 )).
</p>
<h3 id="conditions-for-use-1">
 Conditions for use:
</h3>
<p>
 This Procedure Code is used to claim duty relief on goods re-imported under the outward processing (
 <abbr title="outward processing">
  OP
 </abbr>
 ) procedure with simultaneous release for free circulation and onward dispatch to another territory in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a Customs Union of goods. These goods are then the subject of a VAT-exempt supply to another Customs Union Territory and, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension. The VAT and applicable excise duty will be due in the Customs Union Territory of final destination.
</p>
<p>
 For territories which fall within the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC, use of this procedure code is dependent on complying with the conditions laid down for an onward dispatch, for example, completion of movement of goods in excise suspense requirements.
</p>
<p>
 Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (
 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">
  UCC
 </abbr>
 ), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.
</p>
<p>
 An
 <abbr title="outward processing">
  OP
 </abbr>
 authorisation, valid at the time of export, is needed to use this procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in
 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">
