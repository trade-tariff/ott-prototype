 Description of procedure:
</h3>
<p>
 The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.
</p>
<p>
 Release for free circulation of goods simultaneously re-dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a Customs Union and where the goods have been previously entered to inward processing (Article 256 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (
 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">
  UCC
 </abbr>
 )).
</p>
<h3 id="conditions-for-use-2">
 Conditions for use:
</h3>
<p>
 This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation and dispatch to another territory in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a customs union for goods which were previously entered to inward processing (
 <abbr title="inward processing">
  IP
 </abbr>
 ). These goods are then the subject of a VAT-exempt supply to another Customs Union Territory and, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension. The VAT and applicable excise duty will be due in the Customs Union Territory of final destination.
</p>
<p>
 For territories which fall within the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC, use of this procedure code is dependent on complying with the conditions laid down for an onward dispatch, for example, completion of movement of goods in excise suspense requirements.
</p>
<p>
 Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (
 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">
  UCC
 </abbr>
 ), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.
</p>
<p>
 An Inward Processing (
 <abbr title="inward processing">
  IP
 </abbr>
 ) authorisation, valid at the time the goods were entered to
 <abbr title="inward processing">
  IP
 </abbr>
 , is needed to use this procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in
 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">

<h3 id="restrictions-on-usage-2">

</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure;
 </li>
 <li>
  In an unaltered state from the time of their entry to inward processing. Where the goods are diverted from
  <abbr title="inward processing">
   IP
  </abbr>
  , the goods subject to the onward dispatch must have been diverted unprocessed. Where the goods were processed under
  <abbr title="inward processing">
   IP
  </abbr>
  they are not eligible for onward dispatch relief.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>

 </abbr>
 2/3 (Document Codes).
</p>
<p>
 Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Inward Processing (

 2/3 Document Codes).
</p>
<p>
 The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were entered to
