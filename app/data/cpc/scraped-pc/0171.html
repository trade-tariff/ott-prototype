 Description of procedure:
</h3>
<p>
 The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.
</p>
<p>
 Release for free circulation of goods on removal from a customs warehouse with simultaneous re-dispatch to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a customs union (Article 240 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (
 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">
  UCC
 </abbr>
 )).
</p>
<h3 id="conditions-for-use-5">
 Conditions for use:
</h3>
<p>
 This Procedure Code is used to claim simultaneous release for free circulation and dispatch to another territory in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a customs union for goods that are being released from a Customs Warehouse (CW). These goods are then the subject of a VAT-exempt supply to another Customs Union Territory and, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension.  The VAT and applicable excise duty will be due in the Customs Union Territory of final destination.
</p>
<p>
 For territories which fall within the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC, use of this procedure code is dependent on complying with the conditions laid down for an onward dispatch, for example, completion of movement of goods in excise suspense requirements.
</p>
<p>
 Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (
 <abbr title="Union Customs Code">
  UCC
 </abbr>
 ), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.
</p>
<p>
 A Customs Warehousing (CW) authorisation is needed to use this procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in
 <a class="govuk-link" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code">
  Notice 3001
 </a>
 .
</p>
<p>
 The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a procedure.
</p>
<p>
 These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Code used on the declaration (
 <abbr title="Data Element">
  DE
 </abbr>
 1/11).
</p>

 <li>
  In an unaltered state from the time of entry to the customs warehouse, other than those necessary to preserve them.

</ul>
<p>
 Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in
