These completion notes should be read in conjunction with the main UK Trade Tariff, CDS Volume 3 Import Declaration Completion Guide. These are additional notes on specific declaration data elements in relation to this procedure code and do not constitute full guidance on how the declaration should be completed.

### Description of procedure:

The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met.

Release for free circulation of goods simultaneously re-dispatched to a Special Fiscal Territory or other territory with which the EU has formed a customs union and where the goods are being re-imported following temporary export under outward processing (Articles 259 - 262 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

### Conditions for use:

This Procedure Code is used to claim duty relief on goods re-imported under the outward processing (OP) procedure with simultaneous release for free circulation and onward dispatch to another territory in the context of trade between the Union and the countries with which it has formed a Customs Union of goods. These goods are then the subject of a VAT-exempt supply to another Customs Union Territory and, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension. The VAT and applicable excise duty will be due in the Customs Union Territory of final destination.

For territories which fall within the scope of Directives 2006/112/EC and 2008/118/EC, use of this procedure code is dependent on complying with the conditions laid down for an onward dispatch, for example, completion of movement of goods in excise suspense requirements.

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

An OP authorisation, valid at the time of export, is needed to use this procedure. This may be pre-approved (single member state or multi-state) or declaration specific (Authorisation by Customs Declaration), see conditions and requirements detailed in [Notice 3001](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-3001-special-procedures-for-the-union-customs-code).

Goods may be re-imported by a different person to the person who originally exported the goods under OP.

See OP conditions for use detailed in Notice 3001.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Additional Procedure Codes used on the declaration (DE 1/11).

### Restrictions on usage:

Goods must be intended for onward dispatch to another Customs Union Territory at the time this procedure is requested. The goods must be onward dispatched:

 * Within 30 days of the goods release to this procedure
 * In an unaltered state from the time of release to this procedure

Evidence of an onward shipment contract must be declared in DE 2/3 (Document Codes).

Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under the Outward Processing (OP) procedure must be held. A duty calculation worksheet to verify any duty override calculations will be required (see DE 2/3 Document Codes).

The use of this procedure is subject to a full authorisation (single member state or multi-state), or an Authorisation by Customs Declaration being held at the time the goods were exported under OP.

Goods temporarily exported for processing under VAT only OP (DE 1/11 B53 or B54 at export) may not be re-imported using this Procedure Code.

Where the Additional Declaration Type code used in DE 1/2 is: C, F or Y, authorisation to use the Simplified Declaration Procedures (SDP) must also be held.

Additional Declaration Types (DE 1/2): C, F or Y cannot be used where use of the previous procedure (OP) was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration. If the previous procedure was approved by Authorisation by Customs Declaration AI code 00100 in DE 2/2 may only be used with codes A and D in DE 1/2 on this declaration.

Authorisation by Customs Declaration may only be used where the entry to and discharge of the special procedure occur within the same Member State.

Release for free circulation is dependent on the application of customs formalities relating to the release of the goods. This includes the application of commercial policy measures, including any prohibitions or restrictions (Article 201, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

This Procedure Code may not be used with Entry in Declarant\xe2\x80\x99s Records (EIDR).
