This Additional Procedure Code may also be used where the goods are being released from a customs warehouse and claiming both RGR and OSR.

### Conditions for use:

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/10).

This additional procedure code is only to be used where the full conditions of both RGR and OSR are met.

### Returned Goods Relief (RGR)

This Additional Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under RGR with simultaneous release for free circulation of goods re-imported in an unaltered state, where the goods were temporarily exported to a third country (Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.

Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export.

The MRN of the export declaration or C21e must be declared as a previous document in DE 2/1 using previous document code MRN.

Where alternative evidence is provided in lieu of an export declaration/ C21e MRN, the evidence used must:

 * Have a reference number declared against code ZZZ in DE 2/1
 * clearly identify the goods,
 * confirm the physical export of those goods and
 * their duty status at export.

The following may be accepted as a form of alternative evidence where it meets the above conditions:

 * a document that proves the goods were previously in the EU
 * a copy of the export invoice
 * a copy of the export airway bill or bill of lading
 * a commercial certificate of shipment prepared at the time of export
 * a certificate of posting relating to the export of the goods
 * a copy of the import invoice if it clearly shows that the goods are being returned
 * a suitable statement from the manufacturer or exporter if other than yourself
 * a preferential origin form EUR1 in certain cases, contact our helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700 for further details
 * in the case of collectable items, catalogue information or qualified opinion from collectors\xe2\x80\x99 or auction houses
 * stock record book.

Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants. No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.

No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.

In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at export and re-import must be the same entity (the EORI number or named person shown in DE 3/1 or DE 3/2 at export and DE 3/15 or DE 3/16 at import must be the same).

VAT relief cannot be claimed on their arrival in the destination member state if the goods were sold while outside the European Union unless the specific conditions in Notice 236 are met.

Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse with a simultaneous claim to RGR, DE 2/3, DE 2/7 and DE 3/39 should be completed with the relevant customs warehouse details.

Where goods are being released to RGR from a customs warehouse, a Customs Warehousing (CW) authorisation is need to use this additional procedure code, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.

The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.

### Onward Supply Relief (OSR):

This Procedure Code is used to claim release for free circulation with the payment of any customs duties for non-Union Goods (H1), with simultaneous VAT-exempt onward supply to another Member State with, when applicable, an excise-duty suspension.

or a request for VAT-exempt onward supply in the context of trade between the Union and the territories with which it has formed a customs union of goods (H5). Excise duties, where applicable will be suspended.

In order to use this procedure, the declarant must meet the conditions listed in in Article 143(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC and, where applicable, the conditions listed in Article 17(1)(b) of Directive 2008/118/EC. The information required by Article 143 (2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be entered in DE 3/40 Additional fiscal references identification no.

Any customs duties must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

The VAT and any applicable excise duty will be due in the Member State of final destination.

### Restrictions on usage:

Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under RGR must be held.

Goods must not have been exported for the purpose of repair or process.

Any revenue re-claimed at export must be re-paid at import (for example, VAT zero-rated for export must be paid at re-import into the member state of final destination).

The goods must use an appropriate Requested Procedure Code in the 42 series and comply with the full terms and conditions of Onward Supply Relief and the associated previous procedure concerned (as applicable to the DE 1/10 Procedure Code being used).
