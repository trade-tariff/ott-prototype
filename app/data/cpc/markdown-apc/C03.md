*Where the importation of gifts is delayed due to circumstances beyond the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s control, the 4-month time limit may be waived. Evidence of proof of marriage and normal residence in the UK will be required.

This Additional Procedure Code only grants relief from customs duty.

Where eligible to claim VAT relief, Additional Procedure Code F45 must also be declared in DE 1/11.

### Restrictions on usage:

This relief may only be applied for in the member state in which the Bride or Groom will be taking up residence.

Any consignments applying for relief elsewhere in the EU must not be declared to this Additional Procedure Code.

Such consignments may only be approved for relief by the destination Member State\xe2\x80\x99s own Customs Authority. These consignments should instead be sent onwards using Union Transit procedures.

The relief doesn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to:

 * Alcoholic beverages
 * Tobacco and tobacco products
 * Commercial vehicles
 * Articles for use in the exercise of a trade or profession, other than portable instruments of the applied or liberal arts

If wedding presents are imported up to 2 months before the wedding, then Additional Procedure Code C61 should be used instead of C03.
