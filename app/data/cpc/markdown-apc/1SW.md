### VAT:

VAT must be paid at importation unless relief is claimed in the following circumstances.

Parts and equipment (including safety equipment) for qualifying ships (excluding parts and equipment imported by a government department):

 * Providing the parts and equipment are of a kind ordinarily installed in the propulsion, navigation, or communication systems or the general structure of any ship of 15 tons or more not being a ship designed or adapted for use for recreation or pleasure or safety equipment for use in such a qualifying ship, relief from VAT may be claimed by additionally entering Additional Procedure Code 1RV in DE 1/11.

Goods for drilling or production platforms:

 * Provided that the goods are incorporated into offshore drilling or production platforms for the purposes of the construction, repair, maintenance, conversion, fitting out or equipping of these platforms or to link such platforms to the mainland, relief from VAT may be claimed by additionally entering Additional Procedure Code 1RV in DE 1/11.

Goods temporarily exported for treatment or process:

 * the goods were in home use when last exported outside the EU
 * were intended at their time of export to be re imported after completion of the treatment or process outside the EU
 * have been repaired, processed, adapted, reworked or made up outside the EU
 * ownership was not transferred to any other person at exportation or during the time they were outside the EU
 * VAT was not reclaimed or zero rated at export.

VAT will be payable on the difference in value between the exported and re-imported goods (i.e. increase in value as a result of processing).

If VAT was reclaimed or repaid at Export, VAT will be due on the full value of goods at reimport unless placed back under End Use.

### Re-imported goods where the importer is a VAT registered person importing the goods in the course of his business

VAT relief may only be claimed if the following conditions for claiming relief are satisfied. The conditions require that the goods:

 * were last exported outside the EU by or on behalf of the importer who is a taxable person reimporting the goods in the course of his business
 * have not been subjected to any process or repair outside the EU, other than necessary running repairs, which have increased their export value
 * were owned by the importer at the time of exportation and have remained his property or were so owned and have been returned after rejection by a customer outside the EU or because it was not possible to deliver them to such customer; or have been returned from the continental shelf
 * if supplied in, acquired in or imported into the EU before their export, any tax chargeable on that supply, acquisition or importation was accounted for or paid and neither has been, nor will be refunded

VAT is chargeable at importation, unless exemption is claimed using Additional Procedure Code 1RV in DE 1/11 in addition to 1SW.

If the process has been carried out free of charge, for example because the goods are covered by warranty, guarantee or service agreement, no VAT is chargeable on re-importation.
