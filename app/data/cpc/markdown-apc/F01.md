### Description of procedure:

Returned Goods Relief (RGR): Relief from import duties for returned goods (Article 203, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (Union Customs Code (UCC)).

### Goods covered:

Re-importation of goods claiming Returned Goods Relief (RGR) for customs duty purposes only that were in free circulation when previously exported from the customs territory of the EU or a territory with which it has formed a Customs Union.

### Conditions for use:

This Additional Procedure Code is used to claim customs duty relief under RGR on their release to free circulation for goods re-imported in an unaltered state (Article 203, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

Any customs duties refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.

Any customs duties not relieved under RGR must be paid or accounted for on their release to free circulation under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC))

Evidence must be available to demonstrate the Union status of the goods at their original export.

Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.

No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.

No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.

Please see [Notice 236](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief) for additional conditions for eligibility for RGR.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate 4-digit Procedure Code completion notes used on the declaration (DE 1/10).

### Restrictions on usage:

Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under RGR must be held at the time of release of the goods to free circulation.

Goods must not have been exported for the purpose of repair or process.
