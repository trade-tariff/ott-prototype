1BN:  Fresh bananas without a weight certificate
--------------------------------------------------

### Description of procedure:

Release to free circulation of fresh bananas without weight certificates.

### Goods covered:

Fresh bananas under commodity code 0803 9010 00, subject to import duty, authorised to be declared to free circulation without weight certificates.

### Conditions for use:

The consignment must be weighed by an operator approved by customs for the purpose of weighing bananas with the certificates drawn up in line with the procedure laid down in Implementing Regulation 2015/2447, Annex 61-03.

Where the bananas are imported without a weight certificate at the time of release, a provisional weight must be declared in DE 6/1 (Net Mass). This may be calculated by using weight certificates from a previous consignment of bananas of the same type and origin.

The weight certificates showing the true weight of the consignment must be produced and submitted with an entry amendment/ supplementary declaration to the National Clearance Hub within 10 calendar days of acceptance of the initial declaration.

### Restrictions on usage:

Use of this Additional Procedure Code is restricted to imported fresh bananas under commodity code 0803 9010 00.

Regular use of this Additional Procedure Code requires a prior authorisation for Simplified Declaration Procedure (regular use) to be held.

Where this Additional Procedure Code is used by pre-authorised Simplified Declaration Procedure (regular use) holders, the weight certificate must be held at the time the supplementary declaration is submitted.

Where this Additional Procedure Code is used by pre-authorised Simplified Declaration Procedure (regular use) traders, the Type C or F (DE 1/2) declarations must be completed using the controlled goods data set.

This Additional Procedure Code is excluded from Entry in Declarant Records (EIDR).
