### Notes:

Where a consignment consists of several items to a single recipient, the total intrinsic value of those items must not exceed \xc2\xa3135 in order to qualify for relief under this Additional Procedure Code.

Use of the Additional Procedure Code constitutes a declaration that the consignment:

 * Is not liable to Excise Duty
 * Does not exceed \xc2\xa3135 intrinsic value
 * Has been dispatched direct to the recipient from a third country
 * Is not subject to any prohibition or restrictions, for example: controlled drugs, firearms and fake branded goods or labels which may be subject to Intellectual Property Rights

Consignments to different recipients can be bulked in accordance with UK Trade Tariff, CDS Volume 3, Imports but for each recipient the total intrinsic value must not exceed \xc2\xa3135.

For consignments of an intrinsic value (i.e. excluding freight, insurance etc. charges) under \xc2\xa315 use DE 1/11 Additional Procedure Code 2LV.

Additional Procedure Code 1LV can only be used with Requested and Previous Procedure codes (DE 1/10): 4000.

Additional Procedure Code 1LV may only be used with a Declaration Category I1 B&E (occasional use) data set where the following conditions are met:
