### Description of procedure:

End Use goods previously exported and now being re-imported to End Use with a simultaneous claim to Returned Goods Relief (RGR).

### Goods covered:

End Use goods previously exported, now being re-imported with simultaneous entry to RGR and End Use.

This Additional Procedure Code may also be used where the goods are being released from a customs warehouse and claiming both RGR and End Use.

### Conditions for use:

The use of this procedure code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions for claiming RGR and End Use are all met.

This Additional Procedure Code must only be used when all of the following apply:

 * Release for free circulation of re-imported goods in an unaltered state simultaneously claiming Returned Goods Relief (RGR, Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)) upon payment of any customs duties and other charges, where the goods were temporarily exported to a third country.
 * Exported goods had previously been released for free circulation with simultaneous entry to End Use (Article 254, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).
 * The re-imported goods are being placed back under End Use.

### Returned Goods Relief (RGR):

Please see Notice 236 for additional conditions for eligibility for RGR.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Procedure Codes used on the declaration (DE 1/10).

This Procedure Code is used to claim duty (and where applicable VAT) relief under RGR with simultaneous release for free circulation and End Use for goods re-imported in an unaltered state, where the goods were temporarily exported to a third country whether or not being removed from a customs warehouse (Article 203 EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC)).

Any customs duties or other charges previously refunded at export must be repaid prior to the release of the goods.

Any customs duties not relieved under RGR or End Use must be paid or accounted for under Article 195, EU Reg. No. 952/2013 (UCC), in order for the goods to be released to this procedure.

Evidence must be available to demonstrate the End Use status of the goods at their original export.

Evidence must be available to demonstrate the End Use status of the goods at their original export. The MRN of the export declaration or clearance request must be declared as a previous document in DE 2/1 using previous document code MRN.

Where alternative evidence is provided in lieu of an export declaration/ C21e MRN, the evidence used must:

 * Have a reference number declared against code ZZZ in DE 2/1
 * clearly identify the goods,
 * confirm the physical export of those goods and
 * their duty status at export.

The following may be accepted as a form of alternative evidence where it meets the above conditions:

 * a document that proves the goods were previously in the EU
 * a copy of the export invoice
 * a copy of the export airway bill or bill of lading
 * a commercial certificate of shipment prepared at the time of export
 * a certificate of posting relating to the export of the goods
 * a copy of the import invoice if it clearly shows that the goods are being returned
 * a suitable statement from the manufacturer or exporter if other than yourself
 * a preferential origin form EUR1 in certain cases, contact our helpline on Telephone: 0300 200 3700 for further details
 * in the case of collectable items, catalogue information or qualified opinion from collectors\xe2\x80\x99 or auction houses
 * stock record book.

Goods must return in an un-altered state, to the Union within 3 years of export (unless a waiver has been granted). A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.

No changes may be made to the goods, other than to maintain them in the same working condition as they were exported.

No changes may be made to the goods that will increase the value or upgrade the specification.

In order to be eligible for VAT relief at re-import, the legal declarant at export and re-import must be the same entity (the EORI number or named person shown in DE 3/1 or DE 3/2 at export and DE 3/15 or DE 3/16 at import must be the same).

VAT relief cannot be claimed if the goods were sold while outside the European Union unless the specific conditions in Notice 236 are met.

### Release to RGR with End Use from a Customs Warehouse:

Where goods are being released from a customs warehouse with a simultaneous claim to RGR and End Use, DE 2/3, DE 2/7 and DE 3/39 should be completed with the relevant customs warehouse details.

Where goods are being released to RGR and End Use, a Customs Warehousing (CW) authorisation is needed to use this customs procedure, see conditions and requirements detailed in Notice 3001.

The MRN of this declaration must be provided to the warehousekeeper for their records as evidence that the goods have been entered to a customs procedure.

### End Use Conditions above those already stipulated in the 44 series 1/10 Procedure Codes detailed in Appendix 1: DE 1/10: Procedure Codes.

Where, prior to their export from the customs territory of the Union, the returned goods had been released for free circulation duty-free or at a reduced rate of import duty because of a particular End Use, relief from duty shall be granted only if they are to be released for free circulation for the same End Use.

Where the End Use for which the goods in question are to be released for free circulation is no longer the same, the amount of import duty shall be reduced by any amount collected on the goods when they were first released for free circulation. Should the latter amount exceed that levied on the release for free circulation of the returned goods, no repayment shall be granted.

### Restrictions on usage:

The goods must meet the conditions applicable for both RGR and End Use:

Evidence of eligibility for customs duty relief under RGR must be held.

Goods must not have been exported for the purpose of repair or process.

These notes must be read in conjunction with the appropriate completion notes for the Procedure Code used on the declaration (DE 1/10).

This additional procedure code is only to be used where the full conditions of RGR are met.

The goods must use an appropriate Requested Procedure Code in the 44 series and comply with the full terms and conditions of End Use and the associated previous procedure concerned (as applicable to the DE 1/10 Procedure Code being used).

Where goods are being released to RGR and End Use from a customs warehouse (CW), the use of this procedure is subject to an authorisation being held for CW.

When a Customs Warehouse identification number is declared in DE 2/7 all items on the declaration must be removed from that warehouse. No non-warehoused goods may be declared on the same declaration.

Where the INF document codes in DE 2/3 are declared, Entry in Declarant\xe2\x80\x99s Records (EIDR) may not be used.

EIDR cannot be used to declare controlled drugs or controlled goods under this Procedure Code.

EIDR may not be used to release the goods to RGR where it was previously used to enter the goods to the Customs Warehouse.

### Notes:

The use of this Additional Procedure Code is a declaration by the importer that the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EU) No. 952/2013, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2446 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 2015/2447 are met:

 * Entry under this procedure code is an undertaking by the importer/agent to pay to the Commissioners of HMRC immediately on demand any duties or other charges due in respect of the goods in question if the conditions of the relief aren\xe2\x80\x99t met.
 * Agents must have prior written approval from the importer to enter goods to RGR on their behalf and ensure a copy of the declaration is returned to the holder.
 * [Notice 236: Returned Goods Relief](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief) defines what is meant by \xe2\x80\x98Goods in free circulation\xe2\x80\x99.
 * All supporting materials (for example rope, wood and plastic) used for the storage and protection of the goods are also eligible for relief.
 * Evidence of export and End Use status as described in [Notice 236: Returned Goods Relief](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/notice-236-returned-goods-relief) except where the export declaration reference is quoted in DE 2/1 (Previous Documents).
 * Entry under this Procedure Code is a declaration that:
 * If claiming duty relief:
  + The goods are eligible to claim RGR.
  + Any additional security which may be needed will be provided.
  + All other conditions and requirements associated with claiming RGR have been met.
  + The goods had been entered to end use prior to their exportation from the customs territory of the EU or Territory with which the EU has formed a customs union.
  + The goods are being entered for free circulation with RGR and End Use within 3 years of them being exported from that territory unless a valid waiver is claimed. A period of 6 years is allowed for Crown Servants.
  + If the waiver of the 3-year time limit for reimportation is claimed due to special circumstances, insert \xe2\x80\x98Waiver of time limit claimed\xe2\x80\x99 in DE 2/2 as a GEN03 AI Statement. This waiver must be shown to be reasonable to HMRC when requested.
  + The goods haven\xe2\x80\x99t undergone any process or repair outside that territory other than routine maintenance to keep them in good condition, or handling which only altered the goods appearance, for example attaching operating instructions in foreign languages.
 
 * If claiming VAT relief, it is a further declaration that:
  + the goods were exported from the EU by the importer or on their behalf.
  + any VAT due on the goods was paid and not refunded on export from the EU.
 

Where RGR is being claimed on re-imported IP goods, Additional Procedure Codes F04 or F07 must be used instead of 1RL.

Where RGR is used on goods being re-imported with a simultaneous claim to OSR, Additional Procedure Code 63P should be used instead.

Additional Procedure Code 1RL can only be used with Requested and Previous Procedure code (DE 1/10): 4400, 4471, 4478.
