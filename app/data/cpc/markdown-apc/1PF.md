### Goods covered:

Goods to a single recipient of an aggregate value not exceeding \xc2\xa3630 (700 euros) intended solely for personal or family use.

Customs duty is payable at a flat rate of 2.5%.

VAT and Excise duties are payable at the normal tariff rates.

### Conditions for use:

Goods which do not qualify for relief under Additional Procedure Code C08 and are of an aggregate value not exceeding \xc2\xa3630 (700 euros), which are intended solely for personal or family use by the recipient, may be entered at a flat rate of 2.5% ad valorem customs duty.

If in multi item consignments, the total value of goods addressed to each recipient must not exceed \xc2\xa3630.

Each consignment must be addressed separately to the recipient.

Where there are several items in a single consignment, enter the commodity code which attracts the highest duty rate in DE 6/14 \xe2\x80\x93 6/17, combined with AI Statement Code 00600 and OVR01 in DE 2/2.

### Restrictions on usage:

Where the total value of the consignment to a single recipient exceeds \xc2\xa3630 (700 Euros), any packages above this limit must not be entered to this relief.

A separate goods item declaration must be made for those goods and customs duty will be payable at the normal ad valorem rate.

The flat rate does not apply to Excise Duty or VAT.
