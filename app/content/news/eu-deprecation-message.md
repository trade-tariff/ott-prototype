Stop Press - Removal of the country code ‘EU’ for the Country of Origin, Country of Dispatch and Country of Preferential Origin. 

From 8 February 2022, the use of country code ‘EU’ when declaring goods is changing. 

For CHIEF the country code ‘EU’ will no longer be a valid in any data field and the specific Member State country code must be used. 

For CDS, we advise you to use the specific Member State Country code for the time being.  Removal of the country code ‘EU’ on CDS and the Online Tariff Tool will take place later.   

For supplementary declarations that are submitted after 8 February 2022, the specific Member State country code must be used regardless of whether the tax point is before this date.
