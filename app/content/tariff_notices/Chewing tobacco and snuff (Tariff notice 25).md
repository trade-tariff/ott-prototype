Chewing tobacco and snuff (nasal tobacco)

Chewing tobacco is tobacco in the form of rolls, sticks, strips, cubes and blocks, which is specially prepared to be chewed but not smoked and which is put up for retail sale. The tobacco is generally not ground.

Snuff (nasal tobacco) is tobacco in dry powder or grain form, which has been specially treated so that it can be taken as snuff (nasal tobacco) but not smoked or taken by mouth.

Provided that they satisfy the above conditions, products consisting in part of substances other than tobacco are classified in this subheading.
