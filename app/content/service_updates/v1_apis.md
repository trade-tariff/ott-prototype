## Version 1 API retirement

On 31 December 2023, the version 1 APIs for the Online Trade Tariff will be retired.

Any third party tools using version 1 APIs should be altered to use version 2 APIs instead.

## Why are we retiring version 1 APIs?

The version 1 APIs have not been updated for more than three years, and are therefore quite out of date. Documentation was withdrawn in 2021 to help to ease the path towards this eventual retirement.

New functionality which has been incorporated into version 2 of the APIs has been omitted from the older version.

At the same time, supporting version 1 APIs is time-consuming and detracts from the Tariff team's ability to develop and support new features.

Your application is using the version 1 APIs if the URLs that you are calling feature the term `/api/v1`.
