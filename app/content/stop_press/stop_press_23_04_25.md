Importers of ironing boards from the Republic of Türkiye (Turkey) (Tariff stop press notice 26/04/2023)

A provisional countervailing duty on ironing boards from Türkiye (Turkey) is being introduced from 26 May 2023.

## Importing ironing boards from Türkiye (Turkey)

From 26 May 2023, the following changes will take effect:

- A provisional tariff will apply to goods from Türkiye, falling within the commodity codes listed at the end of this notice.

- A duty rate of 4.42% will apply to imports of products detailed in this notice from Turkish companies.


## Payment and reimbursement

All importers of the products outlined below will need to provide HMRC with a guarantee for the provisional duty amount in the form of cash, bond, or a bank guarantee from 26 May 2023. The provisional remedy will end in 4 months; or when a definitive remedy is implemented, whichever is sooner.
The guaranteed amount will only become payable if definitive measures are imposed. If the definitive rate is higher than the provisional amount, only the provisional rate will be collected, not the definitive amount. If the definitive amount is lower than the provisional amount, the lower definitive rate is payable.

For those who:

- Provide a bank guarantee — HMRC will return guarantees through the usual channels if a definitive measure is not imposed.  In cases where the definitive duty rate is equal to or less than the provisional duty, bank guarantees will be returned when HMRC are satisfied that any outstanding duty has been collected;

- secure a bond — HMRC will offer a reimbursement through usual channels, if a definitive measure is not imposed or if the definitive duty rate is less than the provisional duty rate;

- pay a cash deposit — HMRC will offer a reimbursement through usual channels if a definitive measure is not imposed or if the definitive duty rate is less than the provisional duty rate. 

## Action to take
Importers of goods affected by this measure who wish to provide security for the provisional countervailing duty using a bank guarantee, must apply to HMRC for a general guarantee account.
