Please see todayâ€™s changes to tariff:

To clarify that the import controls relating to Swine Fever (measure type 465) are not required
on commercial imports, there have been some changes to the CDS requirements on
commodities 0203, 020630, 020641, 0209, 0210.

If you have submitted a pre-lodged declaration for any of these codes, where the goods will
arrive on or after 30th March, please check before arrival, although declarations will still be
accepted if the swine fever document codes are included.

protect-britains-pig-sector-against-african-swine-fever

CDS and Chief have been updated.
