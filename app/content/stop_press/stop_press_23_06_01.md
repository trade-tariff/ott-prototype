## Advance notice - DCTS

On 19 June 2023, the Developing Country Trading Scheme (DCTS) will replace the UK General Scheme of Preferences (GSP). DCTS has a wider product coverage, revised country coverage and more liberal origin rules than the GSP regime. DCTS has three different regimes:

- Comprehensive preferences
- Enhanced preferences
- Standard preferences

**Comprehensive preferences (1062/G073)** can apply to Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, East Timor  (Timor-Leste), Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Yemen and Zambia. 

**Enhanced preferences (1061/G087)** can apply to Algeria, Bolivia, Cape Verde, Republic of Congo, Cook Islands, Kyrgyzstan, Micronesia, Mongolia, Nigeria, Niue, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syria, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 

**Standard preferences (1060/G022)** can apply to India and Indonesia. 

The procedure for claiming the preference remains the same, i.e. an origin declaration or Form A declared on the customs entry to free circulation, but with wording confirming the goods meet the DCTS origin requirements.

The measure type will be a 142 preferential measure with the DCTS regimes being shown using new country grouping.

The codes are:

|DCTS regime type|CDS country grouping code|CHIEF country grouping code|
|-|-|-|
|Comprehensive|1062 (new)|G073 (amended)|
|Enhanced|1061 (new)|G087 (amended)|
