For the purposes of heading 8524, “flat panel display modules” refer to devices or apparatus for the display of information, equipped at a minimum with a display screen, which are de-signed to be incorporated into articles of other headings prior to use. Display screens for flat panel display modules include, but are not limited to, those which are flat, curved, flexible, foldable or stretchable in form. Flat panel display modules may incorporate additional elements, including those necessary for receiving video signals and the allocation of those signals to pix-els on the display. However, heading 8524 does not include display modules which are equipped with components for converting video signals (e.g., a scaler IC, decoder IC or appli-cation processer) or have otherwise assumed the character of goods of other headings.

For the classification of flat panel display modules defined in this Note, heading 8524 shall take precedence over any other heading in the Nomenclature.
