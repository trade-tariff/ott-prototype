    necessary for their preservation or transport;
    
    (e) the products mentioned in (a), (b), (c) or (d) above with an added anti-dusting agent or a colouring substance added to facilitate their identification or for safety reasons, provided that the additions do not render the product particularly suitable for specific use rather than for general use.

4. Chemically defined complex acids consisting of a non-metal acid of sub-chapter II and a metal acid of sub-chapter IV are to be classified in heading [2811](/headings/2811).

5. Headings [2826](/headings/2826) to [2842](/headings/2842) apply only to metal or ammonium salts or peroxysalts. Except where the context otherwise requires, double or complex salts are to be classified in heading [2842](/headings/2842).

6. Heading [2844](/headings/2844) applies only to:

    (a) technetium (atomic No 43), promethium (atomic No 61), polonium (atomic No 84) and all elements with an atomic number greater than 84;
    
    (b) natural or artificial radioactive isotopes (including those of the precious metals or of the base metals of Sections XIV and XV), whether or not mixed together;
    
    (c) compounds, inorganic or organic, of these elements or isotopes, whether or not chemically defined, whether or not mixed together;

    (f) radioactive residues whether or not usable. The term ‘isotopes’, for the purposes of this note and of the wording of heading [2844](/headings/2844) and [2845](/headings/2845), refers to:
    
    -  individual nuclides, excluding, however, those existing in nature in the monoisotopic state,
    
    - mixtures of isotopes of one and the same element, enriched in one or several of the said isotopes, that is, elements of which the natural isotopic composition has been artificially modified.
