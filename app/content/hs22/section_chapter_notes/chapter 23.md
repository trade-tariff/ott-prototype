2. Subheading [2306 90 05](/commodities/2306900500) includes only residues from the extraction of oil of germs of maize and containing the following ingredients in the quantities specified, calculated by weight on the dry product:

   - a. products of:

     - oil content: less than 3%
     - starch content: less than 45%
     - protein content (nitrogen content x 6.25): not less than 11.5%;

   - b. products of:
     - oil content: not less than 3% and not more than 8%
     - starch content: less than 45%

   - 'potential alcoholic strength by mass': the number of kilograms of pure alcohol capable of being produced by total fermentation of the sugars contained in 100kg of the product,

   - 'total alcoholic strength by mass': the sum of the actual and potential alcoholic strengths by mass,

   - '% mas': the symbol for alcoholic strength by mass.

4. For the purposes of subheadings [2309 10 11](/commodities/2309101100) to [2309 10 70](/commodities/2309107000) and [2309 90 31](/subheadings/2309903100-80) to [2309 90 70](/subheadings/2309907000-80), the expression 'milk products' means the products of heading [0401](/headings/0401), [0402](/headings/0402), [0404](/headings/0404), [0405](/headings/0405) and [0406](/headings/0406) and of subheadings [0403 20 11](/commodities/0403201100) to [0403 20 39](/commodities/0403203900), [0403 90 11](/commodities/0403901100) to [0403 90 69](/commodities/0403906900), [1702 11 00](/commodities/1702110000), [1702 19 00](/commodities/1702190000) and [2106 90 51](/subheadings/2106905100-80).

5. Subheading [2309 90 20](/commodities/2309902000) includes only residues from the manufacture of starch from maize, and does not cover blends of such residues with products derived from other plants or products derived from maize otherwise than in the course of the production of starch by the wet process, containing:

   - screenings from maize used in the wet process in a proportion not exceeding 15% by weight, and/or

   - residues of maize steep-water, from the wet process, including residues of steep-water used for the manufacture of alcohol or of other starch derived products.

   These products may also contain residues from the extraction of maize germ oil by the wet milling process.

   Their starch content may not exceed 28% by weight on the dry product, their fat content may not exceed 4.5% by weight on the dry product and their protein content may not exceed 40% on the dry product.
