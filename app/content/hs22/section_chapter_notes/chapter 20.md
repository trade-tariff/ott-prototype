    S + (G + F) × 0.95;
    
    where:
    
    “S” is the sucrose content determined by the HPLC method;
    “F” is the fructose content determined by the HPLC method;
    “G” is the glucose content determined by the HPLC method.
    
    (b) The expression ‘Brix value’, mentioned in the subheadings of heading [2009](/headings/2009), corresponds to the figure indicated by a refractometer (used in accordance with the method prescribed in this document at a temperature of 20°C.
