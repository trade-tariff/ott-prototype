    - products manufactured on the basis of vine leaves; 
    
    corresponds to the figure resulting from a calculation carried out on the basis of measurements which have been obtained applying the high-performance liquid chromatography method (the “HPLC method”), using the following formula:
    
    S + (G + F) × 0.95;
    
    where:
    
    “S” is the sucrose content determined by the HPLC method;
    “F” is the fructose content determined by the HPLC method;
    “G” is the glucose content determined by the HPLC method.
