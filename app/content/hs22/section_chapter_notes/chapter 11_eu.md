1. This chapter does not cover:

 - a. roasted malt put up as coffee substitutes (heading [0901](/headings/0901) or [2101](/headings/2101));
 - b. prepared flours, groats, meals or starches of heading [1901](/headings/1901);
 - c. corn flakes and other products of heading [1904](/headings/1904);
 - d. vegetables, prepared or preserved, of heading [2001](/headings/2001), [2004](/headings/2004) or [2005](/headings/2005);
 - e. pharmaceutical products (Chapter [30](/chapters/30)); or
 - f. starches having the character of perfumery, cosmetic or toilet preparations (Chapter [33](/chapters/33)).

2. (A). Products from the milling of the cereals listed in the table below fall in this chapter if they have, by weight on the dry product:

 - a. a starch content (determined by the modified Ewers polarimetric method) exceeding that indicated in column 2; and
 - b. an ash content (after deduction of any added minerals) not exceeding that indicated in column 3.

 Otherwise, they fall in heading [2302](/headings/2302).

 However, germ of cereals, whole, rolled, flaked or ground, is always classified in heading [1104](/headings/1104).

 (B). Products falling in this chapter under the above provisions shall be classified in heading [1101](/headings/1101) or [1102](/headings/1102) if the percentage passing through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with the aperture indicated in Column 4 or 5 is not less, by weight, than that shown against the cereal concerned.
Otherwise, they fall in heading [1103](/headings/1103) or [1104](/headings/1104).


 | Cereal | Starch content | Ash content | Rate of passage through a sieve with an aperture of 315 micrometres (microns) | Rate of passage through a sieve with an aperture of 500 micrometres (microns) |
 |-|-|-|-|-|
 | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) |
 | Wheat and rye | 45 % | 2.5% | 80% | - |
 | Barley | 45% | 3% | 80% | - |
 | Oats | 45% | 5% | 80% | - |
 | Maize (corn) and grain sorghum | 45% | 2% | - | 90% |
 | Rice | 45% | 1.6% | 80% | - |
 | Buckwheat | 45% | 4% | 80% | - |
 | Other cereals | 45% | 2% | 50% | - |

3. For the purposes of heading [1103](/headings/1103), the terms 'groats' and 'meal' mean products obtained by the fragmentation of cereal grains, of which:

 - a. in the case of maize (corn) products, at least 95% by weight passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 2mm;
 - b. in the case of other cereal products, at least 95% by weight passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 1.25mm.

### Additional chapter notes

1. The duty-rate applicable to mixtures of this chapter shall be as follows:

 - (a) in mixtures where one of the components represents at least 90 % by weight, the rate applicable to that component applies;

 - (b) in other mixtures, the rate applicable shall be that of the component which results in the highest amount of import duty.

2. For the purposes of heading [1106](/headings/1106), the terms 'flour', 'meal', and 'powder' mean products (other than shredded desiccated coconut), obtained by milling or some other fragmentation process from dried leguminous vegetables of heading [0713](/headings/0713), from sago or roots or tubers of heading [0714](/headings/0714) or from products of Chapter [8](/chapters/08), of which:

 - a. in the case of dried leguminous vegetables, sago, roots, tubers and products of Chapter [8](/chapters/08) (excluding nuts of heading [0801](/headings/0801) and [0802](/headings/0802)), at least 95% by weight passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 2 mm;

 - b. in the case of nuts of heading [0801](/headings/0801) and [0802](/headings/0802) at least 50% by weight passes through a woven metal wire cloth sieve with an aperture of 2.5 mm.
