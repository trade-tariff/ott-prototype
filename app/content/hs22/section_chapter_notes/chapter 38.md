2. (A) For the purpose of heading [3822](/headings/3822), the expression 'certified reference materials' means reference materials which are accompanied by a certificate which indicates the values of the certified properties, the methods used to determine these values and the degree of certainty associated with each value and which are suitable for analytical, calibrating or referencing purposes.

    (B) With the exception of the products of Chapter [28](/chapters/28) or [29](/chapters/29), for the classification of certified reference materials, heading [3822](/headings/3822) shall take precedence over any other heading in the classification.

4. Throughout the classification, 'municipal waste' means waste of a kind collected from households, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, shops, offices, etc., road and pavement sweepings, as well as construction and demolition waste. Municipal waste generally contains a large variety of materials such as plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass, metals, food materials, broken furniture and other damaged or discarded articles.

    The term 'municipal waste', however, does not cover:
    
    a. individual materials or articles segregated from the waste, such as wastes of plastics, rubber, wood, paper, textiles, glass or metals, electrical and electronic waste and scrap (including spent batteries) which fall in their appropriate headings of the classification;

5. For the purposes of heading [3825](/headings/3825), 'sewage sludge' means sludge arising from urban effluent treatment plant and includes pre-treatment waste, scourings and unstabilised sludge. Stabilised sludge when suitable for use as fertiliser is excluded (Chapter [31](/chapters/31)).

6. For the purposes of heading [3825](/headings/3825), the expression 'other wastes' applies to:

    a. clinical waste, that is, contaminated waste arising from medical research, diagnosis, treatment or other medical, surgical, dental or veterinary procedures, which often contain pathogens and pharmaceutical substances and require special disposal procedures (eg, soiled dressings, used gloves and used syringes);
    
    b. waste organic solvents;
    
    c. wastes of metal pickling liquors, hydraulic fluids, brake fluids and anti-freezing fluids; and
    
    d. other wastes from chemical or allied industries.
    
    The expression 'other wastes' does not, however, cover wastes which contain mainly petroleum oils or oils obtained from bituminous minerals (heading [2710](/headings/2710)).
    
7. For the purposes of heading [3826](/headings/3826), the term “biodiesel” means mono-alkyl esters of fatty ac-ids of a kind used as a fuel, derived from animal, vegetable or microbial fats and oils whether or not used.
