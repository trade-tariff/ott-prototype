### Subheading notes

1. In this chapter, the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

    a. Aluminium, not alloyed:
    
    Metal containing by weight at least 99% of aluminium, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table:
    
    **Other elements**
    
    <table>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <p><strong>Element</strong></p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p><strong>Limiting content % by weight</strong></p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <p>Fe + Si (iron plus silicon)</p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p>1</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
    <p>Other elements each</p>
    <p>(Other elements are, for example, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn.)</p>
    </td>
    <td>
    <p>0.1</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(Copper is permitted in a proportion greater than 0.1 % but not more than 0.2 %, provided that neither the chromium nor manganese content exceeds 0.05%)</p>
    </td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    
    b. Aluminium alloys:
    
    Metallic substances in which aluminium predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:
    
    (1) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements or of iron plus silicon taken together is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table, or
    
    (2) the total content by weight of such other elements exceeds 1%.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of note 9(c) to Section XV, for the purposes of subheading [7616 91](/subheadings/7616910000-80) the term ‘wire’ applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.

### Additional chapter notes

1. For the purposes of subheading [7601 20 20](/subheadings/7601202000-80), the following terms shall have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

    - ‘slabs’: unwrought products which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of a rectangle or other polygon, of a width exceeding 800 mm, of a thickness exceeding 280 mm and of a length always superior to the width and to the thickness. These products are intended for being rolled;
    
    - ‘billets’: unwrought products which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of a circle (including a ‘flattened circle’), of a diameter exceeding 125 mm. These products are intended for being extruded.

2. For the purposes of subheadings [7606 12 11](/subheadings/7606121100-80) and [7606 12 19](/subheadings/7606121900-80), the following terms shall have the meaning hereby assigned to them:
    
    - ‘beverage can body stock’: sheets or strips in coils, rolled, having manganese as the predominant alloy element and having a minimum tensile strength of 262 MPa. The sheets or strips have a uniform solid cross section along their whole length, are of a width of 300 mm or more but not more than 2000 mm, of a thickness exceeding 0.2 mm but not exceeding 0.4 mm, and of a length always superior to the width and to the thickness. Beverage can body stock is pre lubricated, with a bright surface;
    
    - ‘beverage can end stock and tab stock’: sheets or strips in coils, having magnesium as the predominant alloy element and having a minimum tensile strength of 345 MPa. The sheets or strips have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length, are of a width of 30 mm or more but not more than 2000 mm, of a thickness exceeding 0.2 mm but not exceeding 0.35 mm, and of a length always superior to the width and to the thickness. Beverage can end stock is varnished on both sides. Beverage can tab stock is degreased and oiled.
    
    These products are to be used for the fabrication of rigid beverage cans, including ends (lids) and tabs.

3. For the purposes of subheadings [7606 11 30](/subheadings/7606113000-80), [7606 12 30](/subheadings/7606123000-80) and [7607 20 91](/subheadings/7607209100-80), the following term shall have the meaning hereby assigned to it:

    — ‘Aluminium Composite Panel’: laminated goods consisting of two flat-rolled sheets or foils of aluminium, whether or not alloyed, each of them having a thickness of not less than 0.0 mm but not exceeding 0.0 mm, and a continuous core of non-porous polymer or mineral material, held together with an adhesive, all together having a thickness of 1.1 mm or more, but not exceeding 6.6 mm. The two external aluminium cover sheets or foils can have different finishes. These goods cannot be coiled.
