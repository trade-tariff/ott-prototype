3. Goods which could be included in two or more of the headings of this chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order.

4. In heading [2904](/headings/2904) to [2906](/headings/2906), [2908](/headings/2908) to [2911](/headings/2911) and [2913](/headings/2913) to [2920](/headings/2920), any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives includes a reference to compound derivatives, such as sulphohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nitrosulphonated or nitrosulphohalogenated derivatives. Nitro or nitroso groups are not to be taken as 'nitrogen-functions' for the purposes of heading [2929](/headings/2929). For the purposes of heading [2911](/headings/2911), [2912](/headings/2912), [2914](/headings/2914), [2918](/headings/2918) and [2922](/headings/2922), 'oxygen-function', the characteristic organic oxygen-containing group  of those respective headings, is restricted to the oxygen-functions referred to in heading [2905](/headings/2905) to [2920](/headings/2920).

5. (A) The esters of acid-function organic compounds of sub-chapters I to VII with organic compounds of these sub-chapters are to be classified with that compound which is classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in these sub-chapters.

    (B) Esters of ethyl alcohol with acid-function organic compounds of sub-chapters I to VII are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acid-function compounds.
    
    (C) Subject to Note 1 to Section VI and Note 2 to Chapter [28](/chapters/28):
    
    1. inorganic salts of organic compounds such as acid-, phenol- or enol-function compounds or organic bases, of sub-chapters I to X or heading [2942](/headings/2942) are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the organic compound;
       
    2. salts formed between organic compounds of sub-chapters I to X or heading [2942](/headings/2942) are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the base or to the acid (including phenol-or enol-function compounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the chapter; and
       
    3. co-ordination compounds, other than products classifiable in sub-chapter XI or heading [2941](/headings/2941), are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in Chapter [29](/chapters/29), among those appropriate to the fragments formed by 'cleaving' of all metal bonds, other than metal-carbon bonds.
    
    (D) metal alcoholates are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case of ethanol (heading [2905](/headings/2905));

6. The compounds of heading [2930](/headings/2930) and [2931](/headings/2931) are organic compounds the molecules of which contain, in addition to atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other non-metals or of metals (such as sulphur, arsenic or lead) directly linked to carbon atoms. Heading [2930](/headings/2930) (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading [2931](/headings/2931) (other organo-inorganic compounds) do not include sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart from
hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivatives).

7. Headings [2932](/headings/2932), [2933](/headings/2933) and [2934](/headings/2934) do not include epoxides with a three-membered ring, ketone peroxides, cyclic polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes, anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, cyclic esters of polyhydric alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids, or imides of polybasic acids. These provisions apply only when the ring-position hetero-atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclising function or functions here listed.

8. For the purposes of heading [2937](/headings/2937);

    a. the term 'hormones' includes hormone-releasing or hormone-stimulating factors, hormone inhibitors and hormone antagonists (anti-hormones);
    
    b. the expression 'used primarily as hormones' applies not only to hormone derivatives and structural analogues used primarily for their hormonal effect, but also to those derivatives and structural analogues used primarily as intermediates in the synthesis of products of this heading.

### Subheading notes

1. Within any one heading of this chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are to be classified in the same subheading as that compound (or group of compounds), provided that they are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading
named 'Other' in the series of subheadings concerned.

2. Note 3 to chapter [29](/chapters/29) does not apply to the subheadings of this chapter.
