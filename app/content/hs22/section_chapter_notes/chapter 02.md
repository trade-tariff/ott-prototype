2. A. The following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

      (a) ‘carcases or half-carcases’, for the purposes of subheadings [0203 11 10](/subheadings/0203111000-80) and [0203 21 10](/subheadings/0203211000-80): slaughtered pigs, in the form of carcases of domestic swine which have been bled and eviscerated and from which the bristles and hooves have been removed. Half-carcases are derived from whole carcases by division through each cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra, through or along the sternum and through the ischio-pubic symphysis. These carcases or half-carcases may be with or without head, with or without the chaps, feet, flare fat, kidneys, tail or diaphragm. Half-carcases may be with or without spinal cord, brain or tongue. Carcases and half-carcases of sows may be with or without udders (mammary glands);

The upper (dorsal) part of the fore-end, whether or not containing the blade-bone and attached muscles (neckend in fresh or collar in salted condition), is considered a cut of the loin, when it is separated from the lower (ventral) part of the fore-end, at most by a cut just below the vertebral column;

      B. The parts of the cuts defined in paragraph 2(A)(f) fall in the same subheadings, only if they contain rind and subcutaneous fat. If the cuts falling in subheadings [0210 11 11](/subheadings/0210111100-80), [0210 11 19](/subheadings/0210111900-80), [0210 11 31](/subheadings/0210113100-80), [0210 11 39](/subheadings/0210113900-80), [0210 19 30](/subheadings/0210193000-80) and [0210 19 60](/subheadings/0210196000-80) are derived from a bacon side from which the bones indicated under paragraph 2(A)(g) have already been removed, the lines of cutting must follow those defined under paragraph 2(A)(b), (c) and (d) accordingly; in any case, these cuts or parts thereof must contain bones.

      C. Subheadings [0206 49 00](/subheadings/0206490000-80) and [0210 99 49](/subheadings/0210994900-80), include, in particular, heads or halves of heads of domestic swine, with or without the brains, cheeks or tongues, and parts thereof. The head is separated from the rest of the half-carcase as follows:

      - by a straight cut parallel to the cranium; or

      - by a cut parallel to the cranium up to the level of the eyes and then inclined to the front of the head, thereby causing the chaps to remain attached to the half-carcase. The cheeks, snouts and ears as well as the meat attached to the head, particularly to the rear part, are considered parts of heads. 

      However, the cuts of boneless meat of the fore-end, presented alone (jowls, chaps, or chaps and jowls together), fall in subheading [0203 19 55](/subheadings/0203195500-80), [0203 29 55](/subheadings/0203295500-80), [0210 19 50](/subheadings/0210195000-80) or [0210 19 81](/subheadings/0210198100-80), as the case may be.

      D. For the purposes of subheadings [0209 10 11](/subheadings/0209101100-80) and [0209 10 19](/subheadings/0209101900-80), ‘subcutaneous pig fat’ has the meaning of the fatty tissue which accumulates under the rind of the pig and adheres to it, irrespective of the part of the pig from which it comes; in any case, the weight of the fatty tissue must exceed the weight of the rind. These subheadings also include subcutaneous pig fat from which the rind has been removed.

      E. For the purposes of subheadings [0210 11 31](/subheadings/0210113100-80), [0210 11 39](/subheadings/0210113900-80), [0210 12 19](/subheadings/0210121900-80) and [0210 19 60](/subheadings/0210196000-80) to [0210 19 89](/subheadings/0210198900-80), products in which the water/protein ratio in the meat (nitrogen content × 6.25) is 2.8 or less is considered as ‘dried or smoked’. The nitrogen content is determined in accordance with ISO method 937-1978.
