### Subheading notes

1. For the purposes of subheading [1509 30](/subheadings/1509300000-80), virgin olive oil has a free acidity expressed as oleic acid not exceeding 2,0 g/ 100 g and can be distinguished from the other virgin olive oil categories according to the characteristics indicated in the Codex Alimentarius Standard 33-1981.

2. For the purposes of subheadings [1514 11](/subheadings/1514110000-80) and [1514 19](/subheadings/1514190000-80), the expression ‘low-erucic-acid rape or colza oil’ means the fixed oil which has an erucic acid content of less than 2% by weight.

    - (a) fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, obtained by pressure, are to be considered as ‘crude’ if they have undergone no other processing than:
          - decantation within the normal time limits,
          - centrifugation or filtration, provided that, in order to separate the oils from their solid constituents, only mechanical force, such as gravity, pressure or centrifugal force, has been employed (excluding any adsorption filtering process or any other physical or chemical process);
    - (b) fixed vegetable oils, fluid or solid, obtained by extraction are to continue to be considered as ‘crude’ when they cannot be distinguished, by their colour, odour or taste, nor by recognised special analytical properties, from vegetable oils and fats obtained by pressure;
    - (c) the expression ‘crude oils’ is to be taken to extend to degummed soya-bean oil and to cotton-seed oil from which the gossypol has been removed.

2. A. Headings [1509](/headings/1509) and [1510](/headings/1510) cover only oils derived solely from the treatment of olives and having the characteristics, with regard to the content of fatty acids and sterols, which are referred to in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 (1).
    Their presence can be determined using methods set out in Annexes V and X to that Regulation. Headings [1509](/headings/1509) and [1510](/headings/1510) do not cover chemically altered olive oil (in particular re-esterified olive oil) and mixtures of olive oil with other oils.
    The presence of re-esterified olive oil is ascertained using the method set out in Annex VII to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.
   
    B. Subheadings [1509 20 00](/subheadings/1509200000-80), [1509 30 00](/subheadings/1509300000-80) and [1509 40 00](/subheadings/1509400000-80) cover only the olive oils defined in points 1, 2 and 3 below, obtained solely by mechanical or other physical means under conditions which do not lead to the modification of the oil, and which have not undergone any treatment other than washing, decantation, centrifugation or filtration. Olive oils obtained using solvents, chemical or biochemical reagents, or re-esterification processes, as well as any mixtures with oils of other kinds, are excluded from this subheading.

      2. Subheading [1509 30 00](/subheadings/1509300000-80) covers  virgin olive oils having the characteristics of olive oils of category 2 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.

      3. For the purposes of subheading [1509 40 00](/subheadings/1509400000-80), ‘other virgin olive oils’ means olive oils having the characteristics of olive oils of category 3 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.

    C. Subheading [1509 90 00](/subheadings/1509900000-80) covers olive oil obtained by the treatment of olive oils of subheading [1509 20 00](/subheadings/1509200000-80), [1509 30 00](/subheadings/1509300000-80), and/or [1509 40 00](/subheadings/1509400000-80), whether or not blended with extra virgin olive oil or virgin olive oil, and having the characteristics of olive oils of categories 4 and 5 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.

    D. For the purposes of subheading [1510 00 00](/subheadings/1510000000-80), ‘crude olive pomace oil’ means oils with the characteristics of olive oils of category 6 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.

    E. Subheading [1510 90 00](/subheadings/1510900000-80) covers oils obtained by the treatment of oils of subheading [1510 10 00](/subheadings/1510100000-80), whether or not blended with extra virgin olive oil or virgin olive oil, and oils not having the characteristics of the oils referred to in points B, C and D of this additional note.

    Oils of this subheading must have the characteristics of the olive oils of categories 7 and 8 as set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91.

3. Subheadings [1522 00 31](/subheadings/1522003100-80) and [1522 00 39](/subheadings/1522003900-80) do not cover:

   - (a) residues resulting from the treatment of fatty substances containing oil having an iodine index, determined in accordance with the method laid down in Annex XVI to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91, lower than 70 or higher than 100;
   
   - (b) residues resulting from the treatment of fatty substances containing oil having an iodine index higher than 70 or lower than 100, of which the peak area representing the retention volume of betasitosterol (2), determined in accordance with Annex XIX to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91, is less than 93,0 % of the total sterol peak areas.

4. The analytical methods for the determination of the characteristics of the products referred to above are those laid down in the Annexes to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91. Accordingly, account is to be taken also of the footnotes of Annex I to the Regulation.

5. Food preparations made from products of Chapter [15](/chapters/15) presented in measured doses, such as capsules, tablets, pastilles and pills, intended for use as food supplements, are excluded from this Chapter. The essential character of a food supplement is not only given by its ingredients, but also by its specific form of presentation revealing its function as a food supplement, since it determines the dosage, the way in which it is absorbed and the place where it is supposed to become active. Such food preparations are to be classified under heading [2106](/headings/2106) insofar as they are not specified or included elsewhere.
