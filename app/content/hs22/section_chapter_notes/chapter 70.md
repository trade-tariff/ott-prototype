2. For the purposes of heading [7003](/headings/7003), [7004](/headings/7004) and [7005](/headings/7005):

    - a. glass is not regarded as 'worked' by reason of any process it has undergone before annealing;

    - b. cutting to shape does not affect the classification of glass in sheets;

    - c. the expression 'absorbent, reflecting or non-reflecting layer' means a microscopically thin coating of metal or of a chemical compound (for example, metal oxide) which absorbs, for example, infra-red light or improves the reflecting qualities of the glass while still allowing it to retain a degree of transparency or translucency; or which prevents light from being reflected on the surface of the glass.

3. The products referred to in heading [7006](/headings/7006) remain classified in that heading, whether or not they have the character of articles.

4. For the purposes of heading [7019](/headings/7019), the expression 'glass wool' means:

    - a. mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content not less than 60% by weight;

    - b. mineral wools with a silica (SiO2) content less than 60% but with an alkaline oxide (K2O or Na2O) content exceeding 5% by weight or a boric oxide (B2O3) content exceeding 2% by weight.

        Mineral wools which do not comply with the above specifications fall in heading [6806](/headings/6806).

5. Throughout the classification, the expression 'glass' includes fused quartz and other fused silica.
