2. References in heading [2710](/headings/2710) to 'petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals' include not only petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals but also similar oils, as well as those consisting mainly of mixed unsaturated hydrocarbons, obtained by any process, provided that the weight of the non-aromatic constituents exceeds that of the aromatic constituents. However, the references do not include liquid synthetic polyolefins of which less than 60% by volume distils at 300°C, after conversion to 1,013 millibars when a reduced-pressure distillation method is used (Chapter [39](/chapters/39)).

3. For the purposes of heading [2710](/headings/2710), 'waste oils' means waste containing mainly petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals (as described in note 2 to this chapter), whether or not mixed with water. These include:

    - a. such oils no longer fit for use as primary products (for example, used lubricating oils, used hydraulic oils and used transformer oils);
    
    - b. sludge oils from the storage tanks of petroleum oils, mainly containing such oils and a high concentration of additives (for example, chemicals) used in the manufacture of the primary products; and
    
    - c. such oils in the form of emulsions in water or mixtures with water, such as those resulting from oil spills, storage tank washings, or from the use of cutting oils for machining operations.
